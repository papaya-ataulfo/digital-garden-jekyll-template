# Well-met! 🍄

You've found my [[Zettelkasten is an interconnection-based approach to managing thought|web of thought]], a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) inspired by the growing spaces around personal knowledge management, tools for thought, and the indie-web. 

<p style="padding: 1em .5em; background: #efefff; border-radius: 4px;">
  Head to the <span style="font-weight: bold">[[An index of trailheads|index of trailheads]]</span> to find a path.

I've just begun to move my local [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md/) efforts online, so things are a bit sparse at the moment. What isn't sparse are the greyed-out links; those are notes yet to be migrated 🐢. Soon, though, this will be a robust, living environment of thought - a knowledge base to ease and enable [longer-form writing](/writing/).

While these notes are mainly written as part of my own learning process, don't hesitate to [[take what works]], remix it, toss it around a bit - whatever you please.

✌️,
