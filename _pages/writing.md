# Writing üñãÔ∏è

I've done a bit of long-form writing over the past few months; those essays are below.

---

These four are early efforts at long-form articulation of my thinking:
- **[[Pattern is an intrinsic feature of reality]]** is an effort to make sense of some of the metaphysical/phenomenological models I've acquired over the years
-  **[[Living as dialogue with reality]]** is a similar piece, where I make the case that we're always co-creating our experiences
- **[[How did we really get here]]?** - makes the case that we can't really say for sure how we become the people we are today, and...
- **[[Inherited conditioning, conscious choice, and active co-creation]]** follows the previous, in a related vein

These four are an effort to communicate an approach to habit-shaping that I've been developing over the past three years (to be updated soon):
- **[[An intro-overview of patternshaping]]** introduces and frames the approach
- **[[Tilling the soil]]** discusses the first phase, focused around inner-growth
- **[[Composition]]** discusses the second phase, focused around the idea that we can treat habits as creative forms
- **[[Rehearsal and cultivation]]** wraps it up with the sort-of compound third phase, where a habit is rehearsed and tended into being
