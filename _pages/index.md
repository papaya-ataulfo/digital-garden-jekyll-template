an ongoing project to create a genuinely fresh approach to personal growth and development.

<!-- 
Outline: (*Probably, this will end up iterated to include **what I do***)

- modern life is hugely complex and overwhelming, no less there are people literally working to strip us of our agency
- This is a huge obstacle to meaningful growth and development for people becoming young adults right now
- Current mainstream approaches aren't good enough + offer no real hope beyond just playing Game A better
- It can be totally hopeless-seeming to bother to live well - but it is worthwhile; there *are* still people working to change things
- I'm making the bet that *life is worth living* - because we just can't know; things are at play beyond our understanding
- And man - the music is beautiful, even if it ends. I'll bet that it's still worth joining in.

How can we more skillfully **guide our growth and development**? How can we **overcome the mires** of modern life? How can we **become competent live players** who can meaningfully influence the unfolding of our individual and collective realities? These are the questions I'm engaged with.

I'm stepping feeling-first through each day, heading towards this compelling intuition I've got that **we can make jazz of our lives**. That's down the road somewhere - right now I'm working on **skills for shaping habits, developing systems, and navigating complexity**.

Take a look around, enjoy your visit!
