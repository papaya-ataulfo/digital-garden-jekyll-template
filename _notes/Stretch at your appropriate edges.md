## Stretch at your appropriate edges

This is my model for the in-moment act of growth. It's best [[<!--Seek embodied understanding to complement theoretical knowing|-->understood through actual stretching]] - say, of your hamstrings. 

The present limit of your stretch is right where you have the opportunity to grow. At that edge, you can lean into your muscle's tightness and gradually ease through it, into expanded capacity. Do this once and you've just stretched; do it forty times and you'll [[Development is to gradually level-up your defaults|reach a new default capacity]]. 

The "stretching" frame works for inner growth, too. An experience which lies outside your comfort zone gives an opportunity grow: to hold space for that discomfort. To accept it, lean in, gradually dissolve into and beyond it - [[<!--Cultivate negative capability|-->deepening your capacity for negative experience]]. 

Also, if you aren't pushing your edges, you aren't really growing. Maintenance habits are fine, but they don't [[<!--Development is both expanding and deepening your capabilites|-->expand or deepen your capacities]].
