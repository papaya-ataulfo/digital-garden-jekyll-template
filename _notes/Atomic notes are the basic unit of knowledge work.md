*Seeded May 28, 2021*

In any skill, you want to [[Start with the basics]]. Solid grasp of the basics effectively enables any further growth. Playing a single piano key, learning the phonemes of a language, walking before you run - you get the picture. 

In knowledge work, these are atomic notes - clear articulations of single thoughts. ([[This note demonstrates the structure of a note]])

[[Articulating your atomics trains you to think through what you really mean]] at the most basic level, which then enables you to combine those units into more complex expressions of thought. If you know what you mean about the component ideas of an essay, you'll have [[Zettelkasten reduces the friction in knowledge work|a far easier time putting it all together]].

It's like learning vocab in a new language: the more words you have clear, stable grasp of, the better you produce can complex expressions. The more clear, stable grasp you have of single, atomic ideas, the more skillfully you can produce more complex thinking. <!--([[Zettelkasten better enables us to dance with complex thought]])-->
