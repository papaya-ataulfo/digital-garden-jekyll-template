title: We are process

*Seeded July 6, 2021*

Everything is constantly flowing, changing, evolving, decaying, becoming. So are we - we aren't static. Our bodies are constantly changing, our minds are constantly growing. Our "self"ness isn't static at all - the constancy of that experience is something of an illusion the brain creates.

Take a look at your hands. Are they static? Might appear that way, but the skin of your hands, or arms, may hold a record of scabs picked, bug bites scratched at, cuts, drynesses, and so on. The same goes for your mind and emotions - all our associations, traumas, learnings, and so on are records of past experiences, of ways in which we've changed. We aren't static at all.
