title: Growth is a gradual process

*Seeded July 9, 2021*

Once you've catalyzed the growth of a new pattern, the transition into really being that way can take some time. It's more of an organic tranformation than a top-down redesigning - though both approaches matter.

It truly takes a good while to grow into a new way of being. I say way-of-being here because it suggests the more fully-dimensional nature of a pattern better than "habit" does. "Habit" fails to communicate the depth of inner change which necessarily accompanies meaningful growth. You can't *really*, lastingly, change a habit without also undergoing the associated psychological changes. 

Thus growth is a gradual process: because, while it may take a reasonable amount of days to get a new behavior habituated, it can be a much longer and less linear process to undergo the inner work needed... to work out old belief investments, gradually dissolve them and replace them, learn to fully let go of that old way of being, make a [[Leap of Faith]] again and again into affirming that a new reality truly is possible to actualize. 

We tend to stay really attached to our existing beliefs and such, have a truly hard time letting go of them. But we *can* do it ([[Believe that you really can change]]). This is another way that growth is a gradual process: you may dissolve some negative emotion, like laziness, in one schema pretty thoroughly, but it may persist in other areas of your life. This could be a good reason to [[Reshape your-self emotion-first]].

*Notes*

- Develop a pattern one little bit at a time; the asana cultivation example, [[Just get better incrementally]].
