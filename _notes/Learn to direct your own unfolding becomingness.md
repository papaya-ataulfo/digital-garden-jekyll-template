title: Learn to direct your own unfolding becomingness

*Seeded June 3, 2021*

We aren't really taught [[Distinguish growth and development|how to grow or develop]]. There are no structures or institutions (that I know of) which explicitly teach us how to learn, how to form habits and practices, how to mature psychoemotionally, etc. So it's up to us to [[learn how to grow]]. 

If you know [[Stretch at your appropriate edges|how to grow effectively]], you can chart your own paths forward. If you can create your own learning systems and curriculum, your own plan for development of habits/skills/whatnot, then you aren't limited by existing roadmaps. <!--[[Adapt your own approaches/paths]]-->

You can mix and match resources, synthesizing your own paths through all this complexity. [[Opportunities to learn are all around us]]; [[<!--You can figure it out|-->you don't need directions to get started!]]

Of course, try to [[Avoid reinventing the wheel]] when you don't need to - but many things worth doing head into uncharted territory. No-one can give you a perfect roadmap. And besides, [[your path is uniquely yours]].

I think the premise of the [Hanzi Freinacht's *The Listening Society*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society) is that we should strive to create societal structures which more explicitly support human development, but I haven't actually read it so don't quote me on this ~
