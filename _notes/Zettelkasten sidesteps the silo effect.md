## Zettelkasten sidesteps the silo effect

[[The silo effect]] occurs with linear idea-capture methods, like journals or notepads. As you write, you turn pages - and ideas build up like in a silo. Past thinking is continually buried under the present - making it difficult to find particular thoughts.

Zettelkasten neatly sidesteps this in two ways:
1) Digital Zettelkastens have full-text search as a feature, enabling you to basically ctrl-f anything, anywhere in the web.
2) Zettelkasten "flattens" the linear time axis: all notes are woven into a "flat", networked body of thought, and any point is equally accessible in the present moment. 

These prevent the silo effect, and instead enable a useful build up notes ([[Note build-up in Zettelkasten produces a useful body of thought]])!
