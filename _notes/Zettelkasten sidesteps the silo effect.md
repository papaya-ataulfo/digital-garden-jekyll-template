title: Zettelkasten sidesteps the silo effect

*Seeded May 25, 2021*

[[The silo effect]] occurs with linear idea-capture methods, like journals or notepads. As you write, you turn pages - and ideas build up like in a silo. Past thinking is continually buried under the present - making it difficult to find particular thoughts.

Zettelkasten neatly sidesteps this in two ways:
- 1) Modern, digital PKM apps have full-text search as a feature, enabling you to basically ctrl-f anything, anywhere in your web.
- 2) Growing an interconnected web of thought "flattens" the linear-progression axis: all notes are woven into a "flat" body of thought where any node is equally accessible in the present moment. 

These prevent the silo effect, and instead enable a [[Note build-up in Zettelkasten produces a useful body of thought|useful build up notes]]!
