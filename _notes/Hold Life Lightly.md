title: Hold Life Lightly
---

*Seeded July 2, 2021*

*Hold life like you would a dance partner:* 
Sometimes firm and leading, sometimes soft and following; touches here and there, moving through each other's embraces, yet never seeking to control or dominate, always simply to lead or follow, to flow in harmony.

Life is like this - you can't *grab* it. You can no more grab life than you can grab flowing water. [[We're in relationship with everything]], whether or not we know it, and the patterns of effective relationship seem to be relatively consistent:
- Trust the Other (be it a significant other, a parent, a friend, a tree, cars on the road, the cosmos)
- Embrace the Other, which is not to smother and dotter over, but to hold space for Other's authentic expression, becomingness.

Holding life lightly means also to [[Choose not to take things personally]], to learn to operate without emotional attachment to so much. You can totally still feel emotion, but there's a more optimal place to find (probably varies for each of us) that tends to be lighter than what a lot of us hold.

Learn to trust life, the cosmos, whatever. Learn to breathe, and get [[Walking Your Path]]. Learn to smile and embrace the incomprehensible music of it all. It's not possible to understand it all, or get some system of yours perfectly worked out, or anything. Life is marvelous nonetheless.

*Rougher Thoughts*
- [[Hold your habits lightly]]

- This is a main relationship to give more intentional shaping to - holding life with grace, warmth, fluidity.

- "Being less 'hooked in' emotionally, attached, to a wide variety of things means you'll be lighter on your feet, because you won't have so much prejudgement about so many things, and that lessening of the emotional fluctuations that you experience in relationship to things means you'll be freer, less turbulent as you go through life; and esp. this related to not senselessly throwing emotion at everything, instead staying loose and relaxed and investing your energy most heavily in those fewer things that really matter"
