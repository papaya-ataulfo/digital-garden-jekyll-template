*Seeded August 21, 2021*

As we grow and move through the world, our brains are constantly developing models of what we experience. [[We learn from feedback|These models are based on feedback]], and are like compressed sketches - im-press-ions - of the things around us, not so much detailed understandings. 

There's only so much you can understand from the limited feedback we have access to, so [[Our models are feeling-based navigational aids|these models tend to just tell us how to avoid pain and find pleasure]] - the navigational goals that are evolutionarily hardwired into us. To elaborate them, and build more complex, nuanced understanding of the world, we need to actively pursue learning!
