title: Habits ~ Patterns
---

*Seeded July 19, 2021*

A habit is something that you're actively doing on a regular basis. A habit is an active pattern. 
- Getting up regularly at 7:00am and going for a 20min walk is a habit. It's also a pattern.

A pattern is some [[Way-of-being]] that you have the capacity to express, to perform. It isn't necessarily an active habit. 
- The ability to play an A chord on a piano is a pattern, a capacity that you could competently express. But because you don't necessarily do so in a regular, cyclical way, it isn't necessarily a habit.

Calling something a pattern, in this sense, is a way of referring to some feature or delineation of reality that is a particular [[Way-of-expressing|way in which a being can express]]. It's a regular form, thus a pattern. A pattern can be developed as a habit, but a pattern need not be habitually expressed/performed.
- For example, when I'm thinking I tend to make little humming noises. That's a pattern, a particular way of expressing my beingness, *and* a habit, because I do it regularly in that context. ([[Junctures]])

*Notes*

- Your habits have got to have some kind of attractor or igniter... what brings you to stick with them? Identity is a good one here, and other whys like health and such.

- "as an example of a cognitive habit, pegging people into roles, as opposed to calmly integrating new information into a nonjudgemental model of someone's individuality"
