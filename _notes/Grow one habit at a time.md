title: Grow one habit at a time
---

*Seeded June 3, 2021*

Grow *one* new habit at a time - there's no need to spread yourself any thinner. [[we have finite daily energy]], and each day is a chance to invest it. A single focused effort is typically a wise investment <!--([[Go for big wins]])-->.

Plus, [[patterns are a compounding investment]]. Done in an effective order <!--([[Order of operations matters in habit-shaping]])-->, they'll build upon one another to accelerate your development. [[Habit formation does get easier]], but still - [[one thing at a time]], giving that effort your full attention.
