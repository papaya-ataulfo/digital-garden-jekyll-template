title: Habit loops are like backyard whirlpools

*Seeded June 3, 2021*

A backyard whirlpool, the ones you might also've made growing up, are a good model for [[Habits form according to feedback|simple habit loops]]. They're also a great way to directly experience these dynamics.

At rest, the water has a ton of inertia, and isn't going anywhere of it's own accord. <!--([[Good habits don't form themselves]])--> Push the water in either direction, and you'll encounter that inertia as physical resistance - just like the inertia you encounter when, say, starting a running habit.

Swim hard enough and the water will gain momentum, until it's far easier to maintain a stable flow. Run consistently enough and that habit will gain momentum, until it's no longer arduous to maintain it.

Now say it's an overeating habit that's got all that momentum. If you try to swim directly against the flow, you'll have a ton of energy to fight against <!--([[Habits are neurophysiological investments]])-->. It's really difficult to slow the loop with brute force. <!--([[Self-control is an unreliable strategy]])--> 

Instead, learn to [[go with it]]: float along with the loop, neither feeding nor fighting it. Friction will eventually bring the water to rest. This is the power afforded to us by mindful nonreactivity - react not to a habitual urge, and momentum will gradually fade.
