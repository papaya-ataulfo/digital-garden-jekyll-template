title: Distinguish growth and development
---

Growth and development are related yet distinct aspects of maturation. Here's the simple model I've got for the two:

Growth is in-moment stretching and striving, exertion aimed at expanding one's present capacities - be it literal stretching, like in yoga, or psychoemotional stretching when, say, you're learning empathy. In both cases, there's a resistance that you need to acknowledge, hold space for, and gradually lean into and through. [[Stretch at your appropriate edges|That stretch is the act of growth]].

[[<!--Development is an act of stewardship|-->Development is long-term progression]] through stages of maturation. It's the major milestones you reach when you stop and notice "hey, I'm a lot fitter than I used to be." Or "wow, I've really learned to listen to and respect others." You've stepped-up to a new default capacity, through repeated efforts at stretching.

Here's a little sketch (that I need to redraw :) ). [[Growth gradually builds to developmental improvements]].

Also, [[Development unfolds unevenly]], so it isn't really so clean. [[All models are incomplete]], after all.
