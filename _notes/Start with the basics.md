title: Start with the basics

*Seeded July 24, 2021*

When learning any skill, it always makes sense to start with the basics. Walk before you run, and whatnot. You can't be playing Mozart before you can play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.

Further, [[the basics are super high-leverage]], so you actually get pretty far just by developing them really well. It's an 80/20 thing; [[skills grow on a bell-curve, not a straight line]]. 

My own basics are [[prioritize learning how to learn, grow, and develop]] and [[High-leverage mental models can massively augment your intellectual life]].
