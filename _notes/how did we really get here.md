## Chances are, none of us can really explain it.

Here's a small challenge: name seven behaviors, beliefs, and feelings that you consciously decided to form, for twenty-one total.

You’ve probably habituated a number of intentional behaviors, at least. What about the other two? I’d wager that more have unknown origins than not. And that’s likely true of all of us - rare is the person who's achieved full self-authorship.

So how did we get here, then? In some ways, we’re just along for the ride, and have less control than we’d like to think. 

Now hold on, because it’s a bit of a windy road ahead.

## We're composed of patterns

You and I live largely through patterns - habitual pathways of thought, feeling, and action. Our experiences largely unfold through these mostly-automatic ways of interpreting and interacting with the world. From days to months to years, we’re in our patterns. We’re almost always in the midst of them, whether or not we’re conscious of it. 

Behavioral habits tend to operate subconsciously - many things are simply second-nature, like walking, driving, scrolling. This habit-based navigation is energy efficient¹, allowing us to live without conscious attention, which remains free for other tasks, constantly being paid to everything.

Our thoughts and feelings are also heavily habitual. Each time we engage with some experience, we don’t consciously re-choose our thinking and feeling so much as we react through pre-formed, internalized models. What do you think of running? How about yoga? How about environmental justice? It's likely that these thoughts and feelings are consistent from day to day. You've got models for each of them, which yield habitual beliefs and affective associations when you encounter such stimuli.

We’re always interacting with our environments, so we’re near always carrying out some pattern(s). In the brain, repetition spurs reinforcement - any habitual way-of-being is a feedback loop which gains momentum over time, building towards automaticity². Automaticity essentially means that some pattern is sufficiently myelinated to function sub-consciously, such that we start to become less aware of it unfolding. 

This has the effect that we tend to ossify in habits formed at earlier stages of life, hence the annual new-year’s struggle to break old habits and form new ones - not to mention the massive self-help industry. Without conscious change, patterns persist, and nobody really teaches us how they work.

Operating as such - on largely unconscious patterns - makes for a reactive relationship with experience. To be consistently mindful isn’t easy to do. The result is often a lack of awareness of the patterns that we form and reinforce.

If we aren’t aware, it’s easy to fall into some pretty nasty habits of thought, feeling, and action. These patterns can really sap your vitality, and if left unchecked, may derail your life.

Now - let’s look at where these patterns come from, and why we tend to have so little control.

## Some (roughly simplified) habit history

So, some background. This isn’t the whole story, but it’s enough for the moment.

Very simplified: humans evolved to make decisions according to judgments of feeling³. This started with the basic distinction between pleasure and pain, and how they're associated with things in our environment.

Many of these associations are inherited, like attraction to sugars and sex, and aversion to lions and spiders. Others, we learn ourselves.

If a choice feels good, we’re more likely to make it. And because pleasure doesn’t last, we're motivated to repeat that reward-gaining behavior and regain that positive feeling. In contrast, we’ll tend to avoid making choices that feel repulsive, and we won’t likely repeat them if we do try them out.

Pleasure and pain are associated with choices that are beneficial or harmful, respectively. Beneficial or harmful to what? At root, it’s about evolution’s goals: this mechanism got humans to make the choices that best led to survival and reproduction. Edible, nutritious fruit tastes great, and that pleasure encourages remembrance and habituation around that food source. In contrast, a deadly snake bite would leave a deeply negative association - if you survive. This was a reliable way to learn the patterns we needed to navigate a complex environment, by taking in feedback and forming habits accordingly.

What about reason, logic? We humans have really come to pride ourselves on our thinking skills. But the fact is, anything we reason for is motivated by some underlying feeling⁴.

> _“The point of smarts, from natural selection’s perspective, isn’t to replace feelings but rather to make them better informed… though the calculations that inform our feelings get more and more elaborate, the feelings continue to be what ultimately steer us through life." -Robert Wright, Why Buddhism is True_

Seven hours spent researching new laptops is about finding which one _feels_ best, and all the calculating and comparing of specs is to establish confidence in that feeling.

So - associations of feeling, learned or inherited, set up for evolution’s goals - survival and reproduction - heavily influence our choices. See this for yourself by watching the next few choices you make⁵.

You’re still reading this because you aren’t bored yet. We do _anything_ because it feels good. This makes sense - we wouldn’t be motivated to live if it didn’t feel good. 

Back to patterns: repetition of a choice creates a habit, getting you used to that behavior and strengthening the corresponding neural pathways. Feeling thus underlies the patterns we form. 

## A changed environment

This affective motivational system served us well in the past, but it can’t be said to work as well today. The modern environment is very different, such that feeling-based decisions are no longer infallible guides.

Now, it’s incredibly easy to form an abundance of self-destructive patterns. Humans have made highly available the habit-forming sources of pleasure that once indicated something useful (and _scarce_) - sugary and fatty foods, sex, even social approval.

The digital environment is a minefield of shallow pleasures. Social media, endless novelty, abundant clickbait and hook-filled noise - it’s easy to form an unhealthy relationship with it all.

And just briefly consider the constant flame-wars between conflicting ideological groups - regular humans regularly tear each other down because in-group/out-group dynamics enable the seeking of superficial social approval, through virtue-signalling and whatnot. It’s tribal psychology at its worst.

So pleasure isn't a reliable signal anymore. Many modern pleasures can lead into harmful cycles that are difficult to break, as probably all of us know. Ever met someone _without_ any vices?

Mindful awareness is an essential tool for navigating this new terrain. It develops in us the capacity to be non-reactive to sensations, as they arise. You can use mindfulness to sit with a craving for cake, Youtube, or some memes alike, and watch that sensation swell, then fade.

Felt-sensation is as temporary as anything else, and will simply pass on if you don’t get tied up in it. The ability to be nonreactive like this is super useful, and super freeing. At its core, it enables us to be more conscious of our choices. And in declining to react, we don’t reinforce the pattern.

Mindfulness as a pragmatic tool for managing relationship to feeling is used in therapy, with promising results, and it’s increasingly recognized as a powerful tool for breaking negative patterns⁶.

## Putting it together

So what am I saying, with all of this?

We live through patterns. Many of them operate subconsciously, and we aren’t often completely aware of ours. They form and reinforce on the basis of feeling-influenced choices, a dynamic which we also aren’t taught about, in an environment full of stimuli stronger and more abundant than we’ve evolved for.

And that, largely, is how our lives unfold!

We run from pain and seek out pleasure with myriad methods, but only perpetuate this cycle. Throughout life we form patterns from this struggle, and obviously manage to survive. But living through patterns that are unconsciously brought about by a now-fallible evolutionary mechanism doesn’t do much for life, beyond spurring us towards survival and reproduction.

What’s more, the longer we’re unaware of this underlying dynamic, the longer it shapes our choices, and ultimately our lives.

Why do so many people struggle to exercise? Because it’s often unpleasant and no longer necessary for survival.

Why don’t more people eat better? Because they get by _fine_ as-is.

Fine - not greatly, not joyfully or wonderfully. Fine is enough for survival. The _way we’ve evolved_ **does not factor in** human happiness, fulfillment, or potential. Those things have little bearing on evolution's basic goals.

Being optimized for _fine_ means most of us, if we don't make conscious efforts, end up poorly-aligned with the lives we’d really like to be living. That’s a funny thing about we humans - we’ve gotten more ambitious than evolution.

We'd each probably come up with some story to explain how we've arrived here and now, but I’d bet none of us know the whole tale. Sure, we tend to take some conscious hand in our lives, but how many unmindful, feeling-driven choices have we made? Do we really know where all our habits come from - not just behaviors, but how we think and feel, too?

Our lives are significantly shaped by patterns, but we aren’t taught to understand this, or to consciously manage it.

So here we are, going along with whatever semi-intentional set of habits, beliefs, and feelings we’ve developed. Most of these are inherited, and few are consciously designed or informed by good knowledge.

Do you really know how you got here? I can’t convince myself that that I do.

## Unbeholden to evolution

We’re at an interesting point in the human story, right now.

Among other things, interest in mindful, conscious living is probably at an all time high. More people than ever are choosing to meditate, reading about mindfulness, adapting it for all sorts of contexts and purposes.

And mindfulness is one path to unshackling ourselves from the pleasure-pain hamster wheel. It enables us to lift ourselves out of self-destructive habits, out of an us-vs-them mindset, out of avoidance of the discomfort that comes from facing up to huge problems.

The Earth is accelerating into environmental disequilibrium, corporate capitalism is as deplorable as ever, social divisions are worsening, a huge pandemic has deeply shaken our global civilization,... whew. It seems like it’s all getting worse.

Remaining beholden to our evolutionary mechanisms _will_ worsen things. Another option is to pursue a sort of meta-evolution, intentionally choosing to establish a mindful relationship with pleasure and pain, intentionally working to develop ourselves towards more fully-formed, well-matured beings.

When we do this as individuals, our lives become less controlled by ephemeral sensations. We also contribute to the collective shift away from reactivity. We move human momentum away from oblivion, just a bit more.

## Under no obligation

So, learn to sit with feeling, instead of habitually reacting to it. Come to understand your patterns, and shift those that do no good. There’s no need to stick to them, it’s just uncomfortable to change - but that shouldn’t stop us.

> _“You’re under no obligation to be the same person you were five minutes ago.” -Alan Watts_

We aren’t bound by existing patterns. You can interrupt one in any moment, if you so choose. And you can become mindful of those sensations that otherwise drive your choices.

We have an innate capacity for conscious choice. Though we’re deep in our patterns, we can mindfully slow that momentum and direct it elsewhere. There’s no obligation to keep old patterns, and they don’t necessarily do us any good.

Besides - chances are you don’t totally know where _you_ comes from⁷. That current self may not reflect deeper feelings of who you could be. Well, you’ve got no obligation to continue going along with your current conditioning - especially if it does no good.

This is what I’m exploring - to what extent can we change our patterns? To what extend would we _want_ to? Does who we are have any absoluteness, or is it mostly relative to experience? My guess is that it’s a bit of both - we all have natural inclinations, but also can consciously choose new patterns to live into.

_Not all our existing patterns are problematic, but many are less than ideal._ _It can do us a lot of good to self-audit, to honestly question why we act, feel, think in the ways we do._

_The next essay will continue this line of thinking, exploring why we have such a hard time changing, and how we can more skillfully shift our patterns._

7: Also see if you can notice where your thoughts come from. Do you consciously decide to have a thought? Do you decide to decide? And so on. If you aren’t choosing your thoughts, but thoughts have a huge influence on what we do and feel, then… again, how did we really get here?
