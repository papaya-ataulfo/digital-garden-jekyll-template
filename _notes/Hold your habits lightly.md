title: Hold your habits lightly

*Seeded June 3, 2021*

Avoid defaulting to a perfectionistic mindset towards your habits. They aren't going to unfold perfectly every-time, and that's okay <!--([[Perfection is an irrational pursuit]])-->. It's more important to show up than it is to get it perfectly right. Let the habit breathe; let it flex a little. Rigid expectations will do little more than frustrate you.

Also, [[habits change over time]]. As you grow into and through them, you'll learn what works for you and what doesn't. This feedback is important - it helps you iterate towards habits that are more well-developed, and more [[Trust your felt-sense|well-aligned with what feels right]]. So hold your habits lightly, and let them evolve as you grow.
