title: Leap of Faith

*Seeded July 12, 2021*

This is a practice related to the subtle inner work needed to truly let go of an old way of being, esp. on the psychoemotional level, and truly transition into a new way of being. It's an expression of faith, a willingness to fully let go of the old, embrace the new. 

You need to have faith in order to truly change, because faith - or trust - is prerequisite to letting go. You need to genuinely let go of old patterns in order to meaningfully transition into some new way of being. Making a "Leap of Faith" is an exercise that I use to aid in this, where I'll visualize myself leaping through a large door into a "new reality", leaving behind the old one. It seems to communicate something to my psychology along the lines of *hey, this change really is real*. Perhaps there's some power in the symbolism of the visualization. 

The ability to [[Believe that you really can change]] seems to be in short supply. It's difficult to fully let go of one's old ways of being, and to believe that we truly can become something new. [[Growth is a gradual process]], too, such that it's easy to get frustrated, give up, and let old schema grow back over new beliefs. You really need to seed, nourish, and patiently tend to a new state + story as they gradually become your new psychological habits.
