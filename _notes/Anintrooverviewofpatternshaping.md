# Some intro
Patternshaping is a framework for the creation of intentional, well-formed patterns - our habitual ways of thinking, feeling, and acting. It uses a hybrid metaphor of craft and cultivation, framing patterns as objects of composition as well as things to grow. They’re created and grown in line with one’s felt-sense intuitions, and gradually actualized as new expressions of our-selves. 

You first first compose a pattern, giving it intentional structure in three dimensions of thinking, feeling, and acting. Then you can treat that composition as a “song” or “act”, an expression-of-being to practice, inhabit, and bring to life. Having crafted and learned a pattern, you then cue it to unfold in the flow of normal life, and tend its growth as you bring it from potentiality to actuality. 

Actualizing patterns in this way has a ton of benefits. It results in well-formed, personally-optimized ways of being. It gradually elaborates and reinforces neural growth as you go, like with learning music. It also yields subjective familiarity with your patterns, making habituation easier and more natural. And it enables you to give intentional, well-crafted form to how you express your-self.

## Patterns and cultivation
A pattern is a living thing, a way-of-being that you or I actualize as. It isn’t something you just grind into reality so much as it’s something you grow, changing your brain, body and subjective experience. Changing your patterns means changing your-self, and that’s a process, not just a switch to flip.

Given this, it makes sense that we’d want to patiently, skillfully tend that growth, treating it like you might a plant you’re growing - seeding it in well-tilled soil, nourishing and catalyzing initial growth, and patiently tending it to bring it into stable being. 

This is a sort of co-creative thing, where we make the effort to actualize some change, then get feedback as it unfolds, and use that to further adjust and nourish the growth process. Hence the frame of cultivation, which illuminates this process of nourishing, letting grow, and patiently tending to a change as we bring it to life.

## Patterns and composition
Patterns are also creative forms, objects of craft or composition. This view came to me through compositionality, a mental model which says that “(the meaning of) a whole emerges from its elements and their relationships.” Extend this model to patterns, treating them as compositional, and we can notice “hey, a composition is a tool for various creative practices. Why not treat creating patterns as such a practice - why not compose patterns?” 
    
We can do just that, breaking down a pattern into three dimensions - thinking, feeling, and acting - and shaping each of those. This compositional approach to habit creation yields well-formed patterns, and doing it from a creative mindset means they’ll be well-aligned with our felt-sense of how we truly want to show up, express our-selves.

This also opens up a whole metaphor-landscape, a realm of analogies to other creative practices which inform and enhance how we can approach creating our-selves. A few of these are used in patternshaping. Namely, comparison to acting and music, seen in the composition and rehearsal of patterns, and craft, which emphasizes the practical, functional nature of many habit-domains.

## Bringing intentionality more fully into our lives
At the core of patternshaping is a consistent emphasis on bringing greater intention into our ways-of-being. Why this emphasis? Because many of the patterns we live through, in our thinking, feeling, and acting, are not imbued with conscious intention. As-is, as inherited from parents, peers, and external conditioning, our patterns tend not to be that well-aligned with how we’d actually like to be living our lives.  

Not trying to paint with too broad a brush, here - many of us do succeed in bringing some degree of intention to our lives, changing our habits and growing by our own choices. Yet much of who we are tends to follow from how we’re conditioned as we grow up, especially in our young lives. It’s essential, then, to actively seek to grow, as opposed to remaining the people we’re presently conditioned to be.
    
We all have that sense that our lives can be more than what we tend to actualize, that we can somehow express fuller potential. It’s fully possible to bring to life that potential, despite the effortfulness of change. Pattern-shaping emphasizes the value of inner-draw, or felt-sense intuition, in shaping and actualizing changes to our patterns. By acting to self-create in alignment with what feels truly alive for us, we can more fully express our-selves.

Any pattern - the way you live your mornings, the way you exercise, the ways you eat and clean and converse - can be treated as creative expression which we can bring more intention to. If we consider the self as a canvas, a creative form through which to express our potentials, then each pattern is an element of that overall composition. By shaping them one at a time, we can gradually align with who we really seek to be.

# A bird’s-eye view of the process
With the essentials of this view covered, let’s look at the actual process. I think of it as a process-framework, because it isn’t a strict set of steps so much as it’s a sequence of phases, each of which allows for some flexibility in the specific techniques used. This enables each of us to adjust it to our own needs.

There are three phases, which could be characterized differently through each metaphor-frame. From a creative view, you clear the canvas, compose a new expression, and rehearse to bring it to life. Seen through the frame of cultivation, you till the soil, plant and nourish new growth, and cultivate the pattern as it moves from potentiality to actuality. 

These frames get blended because each gives distinct yet complementary insights, and and the practice is stronger when they’re integrated. So instead of just craft or just cultivation, we get a hybrid practice which is informed by both frames.

In more tangible terms, you first clear space for the creation of a new pattern, compose or craft new pathways of thought, feeling, and action, then memorize, rehearse, and grow-into the new way-of-being. The three dimensions are integrated with visualization and conditioned with patient practice, growing the neural pathways that correspond to this pattern-structure prior to starting habituation. Then, when it comes time to cue it into action, the habituation process flows much more smoothly.

## Phase one, “Tilling the Soil”
[The first phase](../tillingthesoil) is about resolving the old so we can move to the new. Our lives, and our patterns, are not blank slates. We’re all conditioned as we grow, such that there are active patterns in most places we’d like to make change. So we need to “till the soil”, digging down, uprooting old ways-of-being, and creating space in which to shape something new.
 
This can be done with a practice of self-inquiry, performed from a state of mindful awareness. Mindful awareness gives us the capacity to be nonreactive to feeling, which, whether it’s attraction or aversion, largely influences the choices we make. By holding space for felt-associations to express and move on, we can both heal old tensions and divest from present patterns.

On the level of felt-energy, this enables us to resolve and move past negative associations that would prevent us from forming new patterns. In the brain, we cease to reinforce the corresponding neural pathways and the feedback loop that keeps us in that pattern. Both of these work to make space for the creation of some new way-of-being.

## Phase two, “Composition”
[Composition, the second phase](../composition), is where we craft new patterns. We tune into our creative senses to brainstorm, sketch out, and shape a pattern, iterating towards a well-formed change to actualize. We lay out the pattern’s structure, crafting new habitual pathways of thinking, feeling, and acting to grow into.

To do this we can use both our own creative senses and existing models. Using both is better than one or the other - good models of some habit provide a place to start, while we ourselves know what'll work best for us specifically. So a pattern is best formed from both models and your own creative intuition. 

The process has a good deal in common with composing a piece of writing. It uses an iterative cycle which moves between exploration and refinement in order to create well-shaped patterns. This enables us to get a pattern well-aligned with our wants and needs, and ensures it’s a viable change to make to our lives. Once the composition is all set, we move into rehearsal.

## Phase three, “Rehearsal and Cultivation
[Phase three](../rehearsalandcultivation) is where we bring the pattern to life, practicing it and gradually growing into it. Rehearsal and cultivation are a set of practices with which we memorize and learn the pattern, expressing what we laid out in composition. This conditions the growth of the pattern in brain and body, and gives us space to adapt and adjust it into our lives.

Rehearsal is what it sounds like - stepping into the pattern and practicing it. You can rehearse a pattern just like you would rehearse a piece of music, or a role in a play. For patterns which would be arduous to repeatedly practice, we use visualization in place of actual action. 

We then move into cultivation, a practice for tending to a pattern as we grow into it. Cultivation is used to stabilize the transition from potentiality to actuality. No new pattern actualizes perfectly right from the start, but patiently tending to its/our growth can improve the process.

Cultivation centers around gathering feedback from how the habituation process is going. With that feedback, we can return to rehearsal to adjust and recondition the pattern as needed, stabilizing and tending to its growth.

Together, rehearsal and cultivation vivify and nourish the growth of a new pattern. Patient attention given to both brings a pattern into healthy, well-cultivated alignment, actualizing it as a well-formed, well-tended expression of your-self.

## What this is useful for
At present, this approach is useful for the creation of set-habits. By this I mean routines, structures, things that don’t typically change from day to day. You’ll likely find success using this to create a morning routine or an evening routine, an exercise or yoga flow, or other daily habits that don’t vary much. 

You could also create smaller habits, little adjustments to your ways-of-being. Things like smiling at yourself in the mirror, letting go of distractions, sitting in a particular way, and so on. I have the sense you could maybe target qualities of your movement, posture, and so on, but haven’t explicitly figured that out yet.

I bring this up because there are domains of life that are characterized more by fluid frameworks of patterns than they are set-patterns - music, language, socialization, etc. These call more for skill-building than they do habit-building, though in a sense a skill is a fluid framework of patterns, like a language.

So again, look to use this to create habits which repeat. I may not even need to say that, but “pattern” has become so loaded with meaning to me that I’m unsure how others hear it, and I feel the need to make some distinctions using other words.

## What about the habit loop?
Current approaches to habit-formation stress the importance of the habit loop, a model popularized by Charles Duhigg in The Power of Habit and subsequently modified by James Clear in Atomic Habits. 

This models states that a habit is essentially a feedback loop which moves from a cue, into a behavior, and finally to a reward. James Clear added the idea of a craving, a felt-desire to perform a habit. This starts to get at the idea that it’s important to actually enjoy the habits you’re forming. 

This is a good model, and it definitely can work well. I haven’t explicitly mentioned the habit loop, but it is present in this approach, too:
- When you shift a pattern’s felt-associations from negative to positive and grow into that new reality, you learn to enjoy that activity. This effectively gets you to “crave” the habit.
- In rehearsal, we memorize an intial cue and condition it to activate the pattern.
- Because we rehearse well the pattern, it unfolds naturally from that initial cue.
- Positive affect can be conditioned throughout a pattern, including the end, where it functions as the “reward”. Practicing actual enjoyment of the habit itself also means we aren’t just making ourselves do it with a carrot on a stick.

    
# Wrapping it up
Through this hybrid crafting-cultivating approach we can create and bring to life well-formed, well-grown patterns, in alignment with our creative senses. Doing so enables us to gradually reshape our-selves into fuller expressions of the people we seek to be. 

Each pattern is imbued with intention, informed by your creative senses. Each becomes well-elaborated and well-conditioned, growing and stabilizing in the brain and body, as we compose, craft, and cultivate it. 

All of this makes habit formation a more enjoyable and less arduous task. When you step into this new pattern it’ll come with a degree of ease and familiarity, because you’ve already spent the time to prime yourself to actualize it. 

...the end? Thanks for reading : )
