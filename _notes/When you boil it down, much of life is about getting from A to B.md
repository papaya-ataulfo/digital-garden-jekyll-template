title: When you boil it down, much of life is about getting from A to B

*Seeded August 8, 2021*

Beneath so much of what we do is our old friend, the pleasure-pain dynamic. 

[[We've evolved to be experts at navigating out of pain and into pleasure]], because these signals used to reliably help us survive. They still underlie so much* - the most elaborate efforts of a brilliant philosopher are surely influenced by the drive to achieve pleasure, regardless of how sophisticated it may be. 

And because [[pleasure doesn't last]], the hamster wheel of life turns on. We all go round' and round' and [[never really reach the golden goodie]] that's supposedly at the end of our efforts. Desire doesn't end; if it did, we'd already have died off from a lack of motivation to do *anything*.

Granted, it's super useful to get good at navigating from A to B. At the same time, realize that *[[life is happening right now]], as you read these words.* We're already there.

**References:**
* Though something tells me it would be overly reductionist to say that it's *all just pleasure and pain*. I've had too rich an experience of the highs and lows of the human spirit to believe that there isn't a more holistic picture we could paint.
