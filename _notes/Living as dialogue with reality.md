Consider living as a language-like activity. This is a statement about our relationship to reality as taking the form of a dialogue, or a dance. Experience is co-creative, arising in the interaction between self and Other, just as language-based interactions are. Thus this relationship is well-modeled by an analogy to language.

Language is a fantastic model to extend to other domains of experience for at least two reasons: first, it features a call-and-resonse dynamic which carries into many realms of inter-action. Second, it’s intuitively familiar to all of us, thus accessible as a metaphorical tool1.

Why make this case? Because understanding that there are languages all around us can illuminate the nature of living-as-a-skill, from the macro to the micro and in many domains of life.

To live is to dialogue with reality. How is this so? Let’s start by looking at patterns, once more :)

## We navigate reality by understanding patterns

We navigate experience on the basis of patterns. [Reality is composed of pattern and nonpattern](../patternsareanintrinsicfeatureofreality); what’s useful at our level of magnification are discernible patterns. Regularity signals reliable outcomes, structures, the presence of order. If we recognize that B tends to follow from A, we make a connection, and start to learn. This learning is the recognition and understanding of patterns.

We evolved to recognize and learn from patterns. The natural world is full of patterns, and our success as a species depended (still depends) on our ability to effectively parse and respond to these patterns. Suspicious rustling at night? High chance it’s time to get ready to fight or flee. Eating that plant caused you to vomit? Don’t eat it again. Oh, but it’s good if you pound and cook it? A further pattern is learned.

Patterns are the regularities in a constantly fluctuating world - they transmit information about structures in the reality around us. The more you understand these structures, the better you can navigate them.

Successfully navigating experience depends on your ability to parse the patterns, interpret possible meanings, and respond accordingly. Where else do we do this? With language, all the time. Any time we speak to another, we’re parsing patterns of sound and body language, feeling into meanings, and responding accordingly.

I’m making a case for a broader definition of _language_ that goes something like this: a language is a framework of fluid, interrelated patterns which, when learned well, enables you to effectively navigate some domain of experience.

-   Understanding body language makes for better navigation of social interactions (if you know how to build rapport, I'd bet your social life is generally more easeful)
    
-   Understanding the patterns of various foods makes for better navigation of the world of cooking (for example, the interaction of cook times, heat, and how, say, eggplant slices would respond)
    
-   Understanding the signals & meanings that plants send makes you a better gardener (like when plants need water, or soil needs aeration, or fruits need harvesting)
    
-   (_I have no expertise here, but_) I would imagine there are patterns in markets which, when learned well, would make you a more skillful trader
    

Patterns are the component-elements of languages, signals which combine and vary in context, transmitting meanings2. The scent of a coming storm is of the language of weather; animal tracks in mud are of the language of the forest; [flashy colors & funky dance moves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XkPeN3AWIE) are of the mating language of bower birds.

## The language of the mountain

I was recently out in Shenandoah National Park, visiting the mountains for a weekend. Hiking down from a peak in the waning sunlight, all of this _language-is-all-around-us_ stuff clicked. As I navigated the craggly terrain along a high ridge, I saw that I was, in a way, dialoguing with the mountain at each and every step.

Each moment was an exchange between the mountain & I. _The ground here is packed and grippy_, _good to step on -_ sure, I’ll place my foot there. _This rock is muddier_, _might be slippery_ - “don’t step here”, it says. Stop to read the terrain: a sharp scramble downwards signals caution, and a keen eye sees where the rocks will tumble and where they’ll hold. A darkening sky (and the bear warnings seen earlier) signal _hurry down, but watch your step ever more so._

Navigating the trail became a continuous, fluid conversation with the mountain. At each step signals were sent, and making my way along depended on how well I could parse & respond to those patterns. It was a language-like experience, a call-and-response co-creation, made possible by the mutual inter-action of the mountain & I.

I don’t want to stretch this metaphor too far. _Language_ works well here, but I’m still struck by a key difference between human language and this sort of mountain language. Human language is recursive - infinitely remix-able. We can produce endlessly novel combinations of words & phrases & ideas. In contrast, the mountain trail sings roughly the same song each time.

It’s still pattern, still an exchange of signal-to-interpretation-to-response, so I want to call it language, dialogue. But there’s something in this to consider a bit further.

<!-- 

## A spectrum of motion, stable to dynamic

In some cases reality is telling a story - the mountain - and in others it’s actively dialoguing with us. We might choose to distinguish _stable_ versus _dynamic_ domains of experience. In other words, there are pattern-spaces which feature a greater degree of change, and pattern-spaces that generally don’t. Interaction with the former is a bit different from with the later.

The mountain trail is relatively static, so the experience it offers remains similar each time. Tumbling rocks, fluctuating weather, and long-term erosion may change things over time, but in general the trail will give a similar experience each time.

 An encounter with a bear, though, could be a much more dynamic experience, with its own exchange of signals & meanings - a different experience each time, demanding skillful navigation of the present situation. There might still be a limited set of possible patterns, and you might be a bear-behavior expert, but the unfolding sequence of patterns which actually occurs will be less predictable. 

I used to work in an organic garden, where the plants spoke through their own language. The appearance of leaves and stems sent visual signals, telling me if they were drying out or drowning, struggling to root, ready to fruit, and so on. The soil spoke too, indicating where it could use some aeration, where it was over- or under- watered.

This is somewhere between stable & dynamic - the garden & I dialogued over time, each day a bit different as the seasons wore on. This calls for accurate interpretation and response to a dynamically unfolding domain of patterns.

But it’s not _that_ dynamic - a zucchini plant isn’t much different from day to day, or year to year. And nature’s patterns - plants, animals, ecosystems - may be dynamic in terms of _physical motion_, but _evolutionary motion_ unfolds more slowly. Dynamic on the micro-level, relatively stable on the macro.

In constrast, we humans are incredibly dynamic. Our culture & thought evolves quickly, such that we’re constantly adapting to new patterns. We use a variety of languages - body language, social ettiquette, music, spoken language. Ideas can spread and mutate and grow far faster than most living creatures.

Some are more dynamic than others. Ideas can evolve much more quickly than social structures; body language is not as flexible as word-language. All the same, humans live quite differently today than we did 5,000 years ago, whereas I’d bet bears are doing roughly the same things.

Let’s revise our definition of _language_ to integrate this distinction:

- In some domains, living is like language: co-created inter-action with dynamic realities. We come to understand many of these languages naturally, but others remain unknown to us. -->

## We can grow fluent in the languages that compose our lives

By modeling living as composed of language-like domains of inter-action, we can see how to grow skillful in living.

Languages are skills to learn, domains in which to cultivate fluency. You can do so by developing your understanding of all the patterns that compose a given language.

We can then extend this to living - if you develop fluency in the languages of the domains in which you choose to live your life, you're growing fluency in living, one language at a time.

Fluency is a matter of interpreting and responding to patterns. Consider English - you’re able to read this because you can match the shapes of words to meanings, in context, and develop an understanding of what’s being said as each phrase follows from the previous.

Languages also have underlying structural frameworks, rules for how elements of the language can be combined to form permissible expressions. Fluency means understanding both the elements of a language and the ways in which they can be combined.

It's the ability to interpret, accurately draw meaning from, and effectively respond to some instance of pattern, in context, whether simple or complex in form.

We could say that the more you interact with a language, the fuller your internalized model(s) of its patterns grow, such that you're developing your vocabulary of patterns. This, again, is your repertoire of both the elements of a language and the ways in which they can be combined. 
- To operate in formal settings in English, you need both a more formal vocabulary and an understanding of the grammatical structures that are common in that register of speech - not to mention grasp of the particular social ettiquette that's expected.
- To parse complex philosophical writing, you may often need a glossary and time to figure out what the heck is being said - unless you've already studied its patterns!

Back on the mountain, we can say that the hiker is able to rock-scramble so well because they’ve got a well-internalized catalogue of models which intuitively indicate to them how to accurately interpret and respond to a wide variety of signals in a wide variety of contexts. So fluency arises from that well-developed internal database of patterns recognized. The brain grows to handle them as you practice, and in time you'll have a well-woven neural skill-mesh, which corresponds to your ability to navigate that domain.

How do we develop those internal models of a language-domain? Best case scenario is that you learn them young. Growing up near a cliffy reservoir dam, I spent a lot of time climbing & jumping around rocky terrain. This gave me the ability to intuitively navigate similar terrain, extending the models learned young to new experiences.

How we can develop fluency once we’re older is another question. It’s what I’m working on, and I’ve got some pretty exciting things developing.

This is a major part of the meaning of *living fluently*. Understand reality as pattern; see that patterns build to languages; grasp that skillful living is the pursuit of fluency in those languages which speak to you.

1: I’m a huge fan of plain language, and keeping barriers to entry accessible. Some standards, but not so much that we’re exclusive on the basis of the privilege of time and energy it takes to acquire a whole new lexicon of complex terminology.

2: Thoughts on context: a big rustling at night might mean an approaching predator; a big rustling in the daytime might mean a deer tripped. Context is important. Patterns are consistent features, which vary in meaning depending on context. -->
