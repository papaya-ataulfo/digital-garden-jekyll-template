title: Focus and release are two sides of the same coin

*Seeded August 3, 2021*

Back when I was first working through how to do "[[Living is a domain of skill|living as a skill]]", I spent some time figuring out how [[yin-yang]] might apply to modes of awareness - hence focus and release.

My thinking then and now is that these two are complementary, like black and white, such that they contain + imply one another. Understanding each relative to the other is how we distinguish the two; [[we understand everything through relationships]], after all.

Focus contains release in that it's a form of letting go - you have to ignore the many other things you could be doing with your time and energy.

Release contains focus in that it's a form of concentration - you have to patiently return again and again to surrender, very slowly working through compulsive grasping at thoughts and feelings.
