title: Focus is how you invest, wield, concentrate your energy

*Seeded August 2, 2021*

Pretty simple: focusing on something is how you concentrate energy into it. Consider this quite literally: any action you take is exerting energy into and around the object of your attention, be it a cell phone, a meal you're cooking, or a good book.

Think of an unfocused laser beam, with a bunch of individual streams of light spread out in different directions. Bring them all together and that beam of energy becomes much stronger.

Intentionally directing our energy into some task, some activity, is a good bit like this. If you're writing something, for example, you are in a pretty literal sense investing energy in order to produce a written object. That object comes into being because of the energy focused into it. If you're all over the place, your energy is more scattered, and that writing won't turn out as well.
