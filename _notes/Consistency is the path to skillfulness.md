title: Consistency is the path to skillfulness
---

*Seeded June 3, 2021*

There's no such thing as skill without practice, and practice is by definition a regular thing. You can only get good at things through consistent, committed effort.

Such focus develops skill both subjectively and objectively. You'll develop your directly-experienced relationship with, say, piano playing, while at the same time undergoing the physiological and neurophysiological growth needed to become proficient. 

To deepen both necessitates consistency - if you don't [[show up]] regularly, [[Habits form according to feedback|you won't build sufficient momentum]].

Each repetition yields further myelinaton of those neural pathways; each key pressed is a present-moment opportunity to deepen your relationship with that skill. You just gotta keep sending the same message, [[Grow one habit at a time|until the growth stabilizes]].
