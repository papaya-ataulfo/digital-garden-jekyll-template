title: Patiently invest your energy

*Seeded August 10, 2021*

Growth is an investment, and investments are by nature long-term engagements. Growth is an effortful one, too - you've got to steadily concentrate energy into some new habit, on a daily basis, for a substantial amount of time.

This all to say - it ain't easy, but it's totally worth it! Take an attitude of patient embrace towards the effort needed to grow. This may mean overcoming various inherited lazinesses, yet again - doing so is entirely worth it, to experience that mature daily embrace of effortful living.

[[Learn to take on each day with an inner smile]], and gradually cultivate your habits, your-self - it's worth it. And so too - [[life's not about getting somewhere, it's about the music you choose to make here and now]].
