title: Embrace regularity

*Seeded August 13, 2021*

[[Reality is patterned]], so regularity is simply an intrinsic feature of our lives. [[Consistency is the path to skillfulness|It's key to cultivating skills]], [[Growth is an investment|growing habits]], developing relationships, and so on.

It only makes sense to [[let go of what you can't control]] - we can't change the fact that life is very regular. There's also no need to bemoan it. [[You can look at anything in a positive or a negative light]], and for our own wellbeing and effectiveness, why not choose positive? 

Regularity is a daily chance to grow, [[Stretch at your appropriate edges|to stretch a bit further]], to calmly and patiently [[life's not about getting somewhere, it's about the music you choose to make here and now|embrace present-moment experience]].
