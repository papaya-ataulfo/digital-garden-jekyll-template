Habit-shaping is based on two techniques with which we can divest-from and invest-in the affective associations which motivate our habits. Respectively, these are mindful self-inquiry and visualization.

Mindful awareness is a powerful capacity to cultivate, and in this context it's applied as the basis for a feeling-first self-inquiry technique. [[Tilling the soil]] allows us to surface, hold space for, and dissolve the old affective tensions that we experience relative to some habit-space, e.g. fitness or eating. This [[Tilling the soil begins the healing process|begins the healing process]] and [[Tilling the soil clears space for new growth|clears space for new growth]].

Visualization can be used to practice new ways of feeling in relation to that habit. Because [[visualizing an activity stimulates the same neural pathways as actual action]], doing [[feeling-first visual rehearsal of a habit primes us]] to begin experiencing it in that new way.

Together these enable us to [[engage with affective associations]]. [[Affective associations drive our habits]], and the power of mindfulness and visualization give us a way to effectively reshape them.

Also important to note is that [[Mindful self-inquiry is not a panacea]]. [[Affective associations aren't set in stone]], but many run deep, and the healing process can't be rushed.
