title: Feedback is intrinsic to our reality

*Seeded August 18, 2021*

Feedback is intrinsic to our [[relative, relationship-based reality]]: any time you interact with something in your environment, there's a re-action. That other responds to you.

Piss off a wasp? You'll probably get stung. Throw a rock through someone's window? You bet there's some feedback slingshotting back your way. Place a foot on loose, rocky ground? Something's gonna tumble.

Whatever you do, something will feed-back to you - which is important, because [[We learn from feedback]]
