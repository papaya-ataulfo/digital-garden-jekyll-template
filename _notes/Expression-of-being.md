title: Expression-of-being
---

*Seeded July 3, 2021*

Consider your daily life as a performance, an act you put on. Any distinct thing you do is an expression-of-being, a particular way in which you/your [[beingness]] actualizes, performs, expresses aliveness. 

"Expression-of-being" is part of the meaning I've packed into *[[Patterns]]*. It's a capacity that a being has to *express* in a particular way. It's an "expression" in the sense that a musician and instrument express music, except [[we're the music]]. It's "of-being" because it's one's beingness that is expressed.

Anything we do is such an articulation of aliveness, of energy, of life. Take one of those, then, and call it an expression-of-being - a particular pattern within the total set of ways in which a given self expresses their beingness.

This invokes the idea that [[We are the patterns]]: saying "I *have* this habit or pattern" is inaccurate in the same way saying "I *have* a body is" - it frames habit, pattern, or body as Other, as Object. But no, what we call our bodies are actually us.

When you're working out, you *are* the working out. When you're rooting-to-rise, you *are* the yoga-flow. When you're laying down, you are that beingness, quietly dynamic. [[We are process]]; the whole thing is us. It isn't just something you do; it's what you *are*. [[We are what we do]], quite literally.

*Notes*
- This is one term that's part of describing the self in such a way as to render it accessible, workable, as a creative object. My language has evolved a bit since I first wrote this, and will be updated soon.

- [[Being the art and the artist]] - we can design our beingnesses, our selves; we can cultivate them, coordinate them as we grow.
