*Seeded May 25, 2021*

You can enter your Zettelkasten from myriad points in the web, meaning it's easy to find your way to any thought you've had, no matter when you had it. Thus no ideas get lost in the build-up of old notebook pages - [[Zettelkasten sidesteps the silo effect]].

If you [[Create and use entry-points to your Zettelkasten]], you can quickly dive into any cluster of notes/thoughts/nodes that you'd like to work in, draw from, add to, and so on.

And because [[Zettelkasten is an interconnection-based approach to managing thought]], you can navigate the link from one note to any other - meaning it's very easy to surf your web of thought.
