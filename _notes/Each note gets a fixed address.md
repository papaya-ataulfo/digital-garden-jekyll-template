## Each note gets a fixed address

Giving each note a fixed address makes it referenceable, which is key to Zettelkasten. It allows you to create stable links between notes, enabling the much of the functionality of a *networked* ecology of thought ([[Zettelkasten is an interconnection-based approach to managing thought]]).

Fixed addresses also allow you to search for and find any note. It's crucial that this is possible, because a NET can grow very large and difficult to navigate without full-text search.
