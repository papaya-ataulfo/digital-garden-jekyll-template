title: Do as best you can for right now
---

*Seeded July 17, 2021*

The best you can do now isn't necessarily the best you could do in the past; it may be more or less.

The best you can do in a week may be better than what you can do today.
 
Just do the best you can each day. Life is fluid, everchanging, and you can't expect a static level of capability from your-self so much as you should get into good relationship with your various rhythms and energy levels. Then give each day your best according to where you're at. [[Stretch at your appropriate edges|Push to your threshholds each day]], though they may be different from one to the next.
  
  - So for example, here's a different way to approach exercise:
	  - Instead of a static number of reps that you've got to hit, do as best as you can on that day
	  - Focus on really good form, doing as many excellent reps as you can get. Doing pushups, you may do five today, eleven tomorrow. Set caps - bottom and top - and get in that range.
	  - Thus you have a more fluid routine.

*Notes*

- Perhaps this is best to establish after systematicity is established, routine stage 4. This is a bit less rigid, maybe still kind of S4? Because S5 would be like - okay, I have 6 different types of pushups I'm competent in, which does my body want today, and what mixture might it want? How can I more fluidly target what my body wants any given day by skillfully improvising within a structure/framework?
- This is why metasystematicity feels so important: static routines can only get you so far, when in actuality your needs from day to day vary. Being able to, say, improvise yoga flows within a framework of competency would equip you to better attend to your unique needs each day.
