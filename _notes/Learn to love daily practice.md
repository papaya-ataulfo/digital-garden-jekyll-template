title: Learn to love daily practice

*Seeded August 12, 2021*

[[Steady, regular practice is an unavoidable part of growth]]. You simply *have* to do things repeatedly to get better at them. So it only makes sense to develop a good relationship with practice.

Learn to love practice; figure out how you can [[embrace regularity]] and bring a sincere effort to it each day. For me, the idea of *[[serious play]]* really lightens and focuses my relationship with daily effort.

This sets you up to succeed in your efforts at growth, because [[we can more-or-less practice ourselves into new habits]]. So if you embrace practice, new habits should come with relative ease.
