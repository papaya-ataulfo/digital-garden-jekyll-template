title: Interconnected notes encourage the serendipitous emergence of insights

*Seeded May 25, 2021*

[[Insights often come from new connections]], so it makes sense that working in an interconnection-based body of thought would encourage them to emerge. 

Also, this can happen because Zettelkasten "flattens" your body of knowledge, [[Zettelkasten sidesteps the silo effect|making ideas from any point in time equally accessible]] all in the present moment. Thus notes/ideas from many different points in time can come together, enabling us to see new connections that [[Note build-up with journaling produces an unuseful silo of thought|wouldn't have emerged]] if we were working in a more linear modality.
