## Interconnected notes encourage the serendipitous emergence of insights

[[Insights often come from new connections]], so it makes sense that working in an interconnection-based body of thought would encourage them to emerge. 

Also, this can happen because Zettelkasten "flattens" your body of knowledge, making ideas from any point in time equally accessible all in the present moment.

Thus notes/ideas from many different points in time can come together, enabling us to see new connections that wouldn't have emerged if we were working in a more linear modality ([[Zettelkasten sidesteps the silo effect]]).
