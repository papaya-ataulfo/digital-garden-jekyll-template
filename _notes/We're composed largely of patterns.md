title: We're composed largely of patterns
---

*Seeded June 3, 2021*

Many of our ways-of-being are habitual. Our brains reinforce that which is most used, developing "grooves" worn deep into our neurons. These paths of least resistance are the regularities through which we most often live.

We operate on the basis of patterns because [[Living is call-and-response]], always co-creative, always dialogical. In a living reality such as ours, we navigate on the basis of the patterns we learn from and about our environment, our experience.

We use these patterns again and again, whether we know it or not. What do you believe? Those are patterns, habitual ways of thinking. What do you do? Those are patterns, behavioral habits. How do you feel? Those, too, are largely habits, learned and reinforced through experience.  

We're made of patterns, whether they're intentionally chosen or not ([[Most of our patterns are inherited]]). What we do repeatedly is what we are and what we become. Pattern is just *that* [[Reality is patterned|fundamentally a feature of reality]].
