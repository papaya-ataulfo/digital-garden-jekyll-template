## Zettelkasten is an interconnection-based approach to managing thought

It's a way of creating a networked ecology of thought, such that one can more easefully perform knowledge work ([[Zettelkasten reduces the friction in knowledge work]]). 

The point is to create interconnected notes which mutually reference one another, such that a useful body of thought can build up over time ([[Note build-up in Zettelkasten produces a useful body of thought]]). 

This emphasis on interconnection means that [[A Zettelkasten is a highly accessible body of thought]]. Also, [[Interconnected notes encourage the serendipitous emergence of insights]].
