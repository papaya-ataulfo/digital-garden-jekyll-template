title: Living is a domain of skill

*Seeded July 23, 2021*

Living is better understood as a *domain* of skill than just a raw "skill". This is because "living" is to "playing Game A" or "playing Game B as "musicianship" is to "playing the piano". Living as I mean it here indicates more the underlying *way you go about doing life* than the specifics of that life.

Maybe you're playing the entrepreneurial game, or the spiritual-seeker game, or the struggling artist game. [[These are all specific acts, ways of living]], like jazz piano or heavy metal drumming or classical bansuri performance are various manifestations of musicianship. 

Just like there are principles and practices common to musicianship regardless of your chosen instrument, [[there are underlying skills of living that are useful regardless of your chosen life-games]].
