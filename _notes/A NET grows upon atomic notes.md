## A NET grows upon atomic notes

A NET is compositional ([[Compositionality]]), so it builds-up from the fundamentals, the smallest units - atomic notes. [[Atomic notes are the basic unit of knowledge work]]. 

It's always good to start with the fundamentals. Patiently [[Articulating your atomics trains you to think through what you really mean]]; it gets you to make clear and tangible your internalized model/image/mapping of something. 

As the atomics are established, larger, more complex models/thought can naturally arise. And because [[Notes overlap]], you'll end up creating a rich mesh of thinking - a networked ecology of thought. 

You may not know what your atomics are, yet - in that case, [[Start from where you are]] and [[Unpack your thinking]]. When you've reached your propositions and terms are starting to emerge, you're in the right place.

Two other framings that illuminate interesting angles on the growth of a NET are: [[A NET grows like a mycelial body]] and [[Growing a NET develops one's cognitive fluency]].
