title: Our models are feeling-based navigational aids

*Seeded August 19, 2021*

The models that our brains create as we move through experience are more-or-less tools to help us move away from pain and towards pleasure. 

[[Aversion and attraction are the two root affective forces]] that played such a huge role in how we used to survive, indicating what to avoid and what to seek out. Because they're so hardwired into us, our [[brains record impressions of feeling more than they do objective, rational understanding]]. 

And that's where intuition, or Kahnemann's fast-thinking mode, comes from: strong felt-associations made with some object are the first to vivify when that object's neural correlate lights up, because they're closely wired to it. 

This is what we could call reactive navigation: acting in accord with unexamined, feedback-based models.

[[We can improve these models]], though, by consciously studying the patterns around us and developing more well-formed understandings.
