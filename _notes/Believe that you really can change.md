title: Believe that you really can change

*Seeded July 10, 2021*

This one is pretty simple, if a bit of a funky thing to wrap your head and heart around.

Believe that you really can change... We're all more-or-less *really goddamn attached* to our existing beliefs, our models of the world and the feelings we've got invested in them. This goes for our schema of our-selves, too. 

If you've never truly been socially confident, it can feel like something that *literally is not actually possible* for you. It can be really hard to believe that you could change from someone who's socially anxious to someone who's socially comfortable. But it's possible: it takes commitment, courage, and faith that deep change can happen.

There's a strange, subtle hooked-in-ness that exists here... Like, the subjective feeling that a belief is *true* runs pretty deep, and it can take a good deal of [[Tilling the Soil|psychoemotional loosening]] and taking multiple [[Leap of Faith|leaps of faith]] to fully detach from it. 

This is one of those subtle inner-work things that's pretty hard to put into words. Believe you really can change, though, because you can. There's nothing stopping you from spending the time to gradually unhook yourself from limiting beliefs, gradually dissolve old resistances, and all the while redirect your energy into actualizing some new reality for your-self.
