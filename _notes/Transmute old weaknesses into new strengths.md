title: Transmute old weaknesses into new strengths

*Seeded August 16, 2021*

[[Habits are an investment of energy|There's energy invested in our habits]], spent and respent each time we repeat them. [[When you divest from an unneeded habit, you don't spend that energy - you drain just a bit out of the loop]].

Now you can redirect that energy into some new, positive habit. Do this steadily to transmute old weaknesses into new strengths.
