title: Reshape your-self emotion-first

*Seeded July 13, 2021*

This idea came to me when writing [[Growth is a gradual process]]... it's basically that one possible design/creation approach to shaping yourself could start from an emotion. Maybe you want to take "laziness" and work to reduce its presence throughout your life, as fully as you can, and replace it with "liveliness". You could do so by mapping out all the patterns you have that feature laziness, and gradually reshaping those to be less lazy.

This is basically a way of targeting developmental efforts which focuses on reshaping particular traits you embody, which could be a good way to do a sort of meta-progression of your character. 

This may mean a lot of changing your-self in other ways too - a wide variety of patterns could have some association of laziness. There's no reason not to go emotion-first - it seems like we're just used to going behavior-first, probably by the conventions of popular habit methodologies. But why not reshape yourself emotion-first, or character-trait first, or mind-habit first?
