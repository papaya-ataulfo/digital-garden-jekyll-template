title: Learn to commit and follow-through

*Seeded August 7, 2021*

Maybe one of the largest hurdles to effectively growing is developing the ability to commit and follow through.

So many of us grew up on instant gratification, and that's only increased with our heavily digital lifestyles. We've been conditioned to expect near-instantaneous results, and when they don't come, it's easy to get frustrated.

Overcoming this is key. Growth is an investment, a long-term journey from one way of being through to another. You can't just *snap* and acquire a solid, well-formed, mature habit. 

Mindful awareness comes in really handy here. [[It's a powerful tool for self-regulation]], enabling us to experience discomfort without being thrown off-course. Useful as well is [[agile navigation]], so that you can orient, reorient, and pivot as needed. Both of these are key to setting a course and reaching your destination.
