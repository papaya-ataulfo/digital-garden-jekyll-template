title: Reality is patterned

*Seeded June 3, 2021*

Imagine that there was no such thing as consistency - no order, no regularity, no recognizable form or structure to anything. Notwithstanding that you wouldn't exist anymore, this would not be our reality. Pattern *is* a fundamental feature of our reality.

This is self-evident; consider basic physics. It's all about the regular forms reality takes - what kinds of atoms there are, how they combine into molecules, the structures and ordering at those levels of magnification. 

More broadly, science could be described as a mass effort in pattern-mapping. This is what scientists look for: regularities in the fabric of reality that they can attempt to codify (Yet [[reality is evolving]], so [[maps can become outdated]]).

Coffee cups are also patterns; so are the behavioral tendencies of the average corgi; these words are complex articulations of patterns, regular glyph-forms which build to words and then phrases in fluid-yet-recognizable grammatical structures.

Look around you - pattern is everywhere.
