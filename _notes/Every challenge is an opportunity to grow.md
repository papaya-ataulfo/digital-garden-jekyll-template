title: Every challenge is an opportunity to grow

*Seeded August 17, 2021*

[[Life will always throw challenges at us]] - difficult problems to solve in our work and personal lives, existential anxieties, cut-and-dry hardships, and so on.

Take these as opportunities to grow, [[Do as best you can for right now|as often as you can manage]]. It isn't always possible - sometimes you're just exhausted, worn-out - but do work to consistently face up to your life's challenges as moments in which to prove what you're made of, [[Stretch at your appropriate edges|stretch just a bit further]], surmount another climb.

Do so steadily, and you'll [[get just a bit better each day]] - which is a marvelous way to stay growing, stay improving.
