title: This note demonstrates the structure of a note

*Seeded May 28, 2021*

It contains a header, as above. [[Each note gets a fixed address]], a unique identifier, which can be the title of note - that's how I'm doing it here.

It contains a body - this writing here. The body is where you articulate the thought/idea/etc. that the note is about.

And below sits a list of references, so that you can note down where you got your information from, be it an outside source or your own thinking.
