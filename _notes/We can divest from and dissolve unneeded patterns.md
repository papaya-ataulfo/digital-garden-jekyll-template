title: Patiently divest energy, dissolve old patterns

*Seeded August 14, 2021*

[[Feeling majorly influences our patterns|Feeling typically drives our choices, thus our habits]]. Luckily for us, [[Mindful awareness enables us to become nonreactive to affective drives]].

If you don't react to the urge to perform some habit, the loop doesn't fully unfold and [[the habit isn't reinforced]]. If that corresponding neural circuitry goes unused for a while, it fades in strength.

So with mindful awareness, we can consciously divest from existing patterns of ours. This is easier said than done, yet it's still a core skill to [[add to your toolbox for dissolving old habits]].
