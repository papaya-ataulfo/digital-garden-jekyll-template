title: Development is to gradually level-up your defaults

*Seeded June 3, 2021*

Whereas growth is in-moment bumping-the-ceiling, development is longer-term leveling-up of your defaults. <!--[[Development is both expanding and deepening your capabilites--> It's to deepen existing capabilites, as well as cultivate wholly new ones. In both cases, a "developmental stride" could be described as reaching and stabilizing at a capacity not previously embodied, be it of mind, body, spirit, or a mixture.

[Development is](https://integralwithoutborders.org/sites/default/files/resources/Overview%20of%20Developmental%20Levels.pdf) [generally talked about](https://tomprof.stanford.edu/posting/1110)[in stages](https://vividness.live/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence). It's like a medium-grained delineation of the process of maturation, whereas growth is more finely-grained. [[Stretch at your appropriate edges|Many little stretches]] compound into larger developmental strides. 

It's always important to remember that these are just models, and [[all models are incomplete]]. Regardless, growth and development are useful and complementary ways to look at the unfolding and emergence of mature human beings.
