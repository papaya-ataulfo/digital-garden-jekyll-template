*Seeded May 25, 2021*

[[Zettelkasten is an interconnection-based approach to managing thought]], and this emphasis on connections means that no note gets lost or wasted. 

As you add notes into the network, they form connections with others. This produces an [[A Zettelkasten is a highly accessible body of thought|easily navigable *web* of thought]]. [[A NET grows upon atomic notes|Your body of thought grows upon these atomic notes]]. 

Importantly, [[Zettelkasten sidesteps the silo effect]], which we get with typical note-taking strategies like journaling ([[Note build-up with journaling produces an unuseful silo of thought]]).
