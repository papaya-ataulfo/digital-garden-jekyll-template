## Learn to judge what is atomic by intuition

There aren't any clear, one-size-fits-all rules to follow for note-making. An atomic may be a little longer, a little shorter; you may want to be very precise, or less so. It depends on *you*, and your wants and needs.

How precise do you want to get with your thinking? What do you value, and how might that affect the time and effort you allot to growing your NET? Does your project have any specific requirements?

[[The best way to learn is by doing]]. Get writing, and you'll find out what works for you. Then you can reflect ([[Make it tangible]]), and establish clearly your preferences.
