*Seeded August 15, 2021*

[[Discomfort is an intrinsic part of growth]], of [[living effortfully]]. If you can experience it steadily, even embrace it, you'll be better able to stretch, expand, and develop as a human truly engaged with living.

It's important to [[get good with both physiological and psychoemotional discomfort]]. They're similar, yet distinct, and each needs focused attention.
