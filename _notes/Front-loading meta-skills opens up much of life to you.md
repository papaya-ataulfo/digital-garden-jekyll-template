title: Front-loading meta-skills opens up much of life to you
---

*Seeded July 28, 2021*

If you [[prioritize learning how to learn, grow, and develop]], then you'll have a far easier time building further skills and expanding as a person. These abilities underlie any other skill in life, from piano to basketball to social fluency, and will enable you to devise efficient strategies for the development of new capacities.

Front loading basic, high-leverage meta-skills empowers you to confidently say "*yeah, I could do this difficult thing that's currently beyond my capacities*" because you know you could get there, and you know *how* you'll get there. [[You aren't limited by domain-specific learning methods]], and can instead [[chart your own developmental course]] because you just *know how to grow*.
