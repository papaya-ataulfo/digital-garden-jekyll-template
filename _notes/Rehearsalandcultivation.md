# Rehearsal and Cultivation
The final phase cycles two practices, rehearsal and cultivation. These work in complement to to vivify and tend the growth of the pattern we’ve set out. 

We first step into rehearsal, where we practice the pattern, bringing it to life with expressive nuance and learning it well. Rehearsal serves to both familiarize us with the pattern and to reinforce corresponding growth in the brain and body. This “preconditioning” means that in-moment performance will follow a well-learned path, easing habituation to a good degree.

Cultivation follows rehearsal, and is performed as we cue the pattern into our lives. It’s a simple practice of allowing space for the co-creative growth of the pattern, gathering feedback, and returning to rehearsal to adjust and nourish as needed. Tending to the growth of a pattern stabilizes and improves the transition from potentiality to actuality. 

Together rehearsal and cultivation vivify and nourish the growth of this new way-of-being, taking it from potentiality to stable actuality.

# Learning the pattern
## Memorize the composition
We start by simply memorizing the composition. Memorizing the composition yields “neural scaffolding”, a sort of basic structure of associated information, from which we’ll further grow the pattern.  

Early on in creating this approach, I was experimenting with the role of memory in habit-formation. I found that associating a behavioral cue with some juncture/feature in the flow of your day resulted in a sort of mental “prompt”, and increased ease of performing the prompted behavior. It was like laying a signpost along the path I usually took, reminding myself of another possible path to take. 

Over time this expanded into a practice of memorizing whole sequences of cues and responses, similarly to habit-stacking, except with smaller-scale segments of action. By doing this, we not only place a signpost, we also lay-out a clear pathway through some habit.  

For the behavior, we memorize the composition’s action-segments as a sequence of cues and responses. Each action cues the next, and by memorizing these cues we create stable, effortless knowledge of the pathway we’ll take through this habit. For the beliefs, we associate our affirmations with images that evoke the corresponding felt-states. 
    
To memorize all this we can use Anki, a free spaced-repetition program that essentially functions as supercharged flashcard software. It uses an algorithm based on findings that spacing out instances of recall greatly improves memory.* This means we can easily and efficiently memorize the cue-structure of our compositions, such that they’ll arise naturally in-moment. 
    
## Diving into rehearsal
Now on to rehearsal. Here we cycle deep practice and “playing through” the pattern, to optimize individual chunks and then integrate them into a fluid whole. This is not unlike learning to play a song. You try it out, then work through it bar by bar, first acquiring raw mechanical competency and then adding in feeling. Repeating this, you gradually put it all together.

“Playing through” the pattern is just what it sounds like - simply step into the pattern and carry it out. This further familiarizes you with what you’ve crafted, and stimulates corresponding neural pathways. We play through the pattern a few times first in order to stabilize the sequence of cues we memorized.

To further hone the pattern, we use deep practice. Deep practice is essentially a micro-iterative practice, a process of performing, reflecting on, and refining one chunk at a time. You carry out a segment of the behavior, then seek feedback by checking in with your vision. With that feedback, note adjustments and repeat the behavior accordingly. Patient repetition of this cycle, chunk by chunk, allows us to refine/optimize a pattern, bringing it into alignment with our vision for it.

## Two varieties of rehearsal
There’s two varieties of rehearsal, because while some patterns can actually be practiced, others would be arduous or infeasible to carry out repeatedly. Fortunately, there’s another way to rehearse those patterns.

Normal, actual rehearsal is used with patterns that aren’t a problem to practice. Morning routines, organizational and cleaning habits, social patterns, etc. - these can all be normally rehearsed. 

We can instead use “virtual” rehearsal when it isn’t feasible to literally practice some pattern. For things like exercise routines, cold showering, cooking, etc. visualization replaces actual practice. 

In virtual rehearsal we create a near-simulation of a pattern, getting as close to performing it as possible and then visualizing it. So you might get in the shower but stop short of turning on the cold, and visualize it instead. Or, you might get on your hands and knees to visualize pushups. 

## Treating habits as skills
Both vizualization and actual practice fire a pattern’s corresponding neural pathways, thus reinforcing that growth. This is how we precondition the pattern - by targeting its neural growth in the same way you would when learning a skill.  

It’s common knowledge that habits form through repetition, so the usual approach is to try to do it daily until it sticks. As far as I know, though, nobody said you can’t practice a habit multiple times in one sitting. 
This doesn’t build daily consistency, but it does myelinate the habit, building our capacity to access the state and perform the flow. And because we get good at flowing through this pattern before trying to habituate it, daily consistency is far easier to stick with. 

Rehearsal is also our space to add nuance, expressiveness, and further personalization to our patterns. Once you’ve smoothed out behavioral flow, you can add in your felt-state, and this is usually where you can find ways to enliven the pattern as you like. 

Maybe you want to add rhythm to your routines, or dance a little as you get out of bed. Maybe you’ll find cool ways of optimizing your movement through activities. There’s no need to do it any particular way - just however feels good to you. I personally lean a bit towards practical function over artfulness, hence my preference to frame this as craft rather than art. 

## Rehearsal in practice
What follows is a breakdown of how rehearsal typically goes.

We start with practice of the Anki deck, and if this is the first session, by learning the cards to begin with. Practice by recalling each flashcard, strengthening memory of the sequence of cues and affirming each belief and feeling pair as they arise (I tend not to try for more than ~two new belief-feeling pairs at once.)

Then we “play through” the “song” a few times. You carry out the pattern, invoking the “vibe” and simply flowing through the pathway you’ve laid out. Use actual rehearsal if you can, virtual rehearsal if not, visualizing instead. After one or two passes to simply get warmed up, we move into deep practice.

We use deep practice to learn the pattern chunk by chunk. First learn the raw mechanics of the pattern, smoothing out the behavioral flow of each chunk. This builds basic competency, to which we then add the felt-state. Affirm your new beliefs, call up that energy, and again practice the pattern, imbuing each chunk with the felt-state you want to experience it through. 

Then we integrate the chunks by practicing them together. Take two and play them through, smoothing out the flow between them. Integrate this with the next two chunks, then do four, and so on. 

You don’t need to be overly methodical, but again, patience will improve what practice yields. Your pattern also may not be very long - it could be just two or three cues, in which case you may have only a few chunks to practice.

Rehearsal is meant to be a patient process, so there’s no need to do it all in one go. Cycle “playing through” and deep practice until your pattern feels well-cultivated. Give each chunk due attention, practicing and adjusting it until it feels good, then integrate it into the overall flow. 

If you’re like me, you may need to work through some resistance to patient practice - yet it’ll be worth it. Learning and practicing a pattern like this yields fluid, well-conditioned state and flow, and sets us up for a very manageable habituation effort. 

## Use your vision as your goal-form for the pattern
Throughout rehearsal, keep checking in with your vision. Seek to align the pattern with it, using that vision as feedback to inform your shaping efforts. Doing this, gradually bring the actual pattern into alignment with the potential you’ve sensed into.

Rehearse until your pattern unfolds smoothly and you’re satisfied with how it feels. The corresponding neural growth should be well-conditioned by then. This could take one week or three, depending on whether you’re learning a complex, two-hour morning routine, or doing something simpler like a morning walk or a habit of listening more presently. 

Once the pattern is well-rehearsed, habituation comes simply by building consistency with an initial cue. If you can smoothly perform the whole pattern on cue, then that first cue is the only thing we need to habituate. So - choose an initial cue, condition it to the start of this pattern, and place it in your day to prompt you down that new pathway.

# Moving into cultivation

Now we’ll move into cultivation, a simple follow-through practice which aims to tend and stabilize our growing-into this pattern. It centers around the gathering of feedback, which is used to “weed” and nourish our growth.

This is as simple as keeping notes as you grow into the pattern. How is it actualizing? Are there elements of it that aren’t as strong as others? Does it need a bit more energizing here or there? Pay attention to which parts of it are going well, and which need a bit more care. 

Both the positive and the negative feedback are useful. Positive feedback can be taken as an opportunity to add reference points to our new belief-structure/schema. When you carry out a pattern and are experiencing some new thought-space as generated by your new belief-story, you might spontaneously come to other empowering thoughts. These can be noted down, then added to the anki deck and integrated with the first belief-feeling pair. This adds to the new schema, stabilizes it, and helps it to grow over the old one.

You might also encounter contradictory thought-patterns. This is an opportunity to hold space, release them, and refocus your energy into the new patterns. You can even take the contradictory patterns as an opportunity to reverse and add in another supporting belief. This is like further undoing the old schema-web, and growing a new one in its place.

The negative feedback is used to “weed” and nourish our growth into this pattern. Old feeling and thinking may rearise as you go, which is sort of like “weeds” sprouting back up in recently tilled soil. When this happens, we again hold space for that energy to express, again releasing it. Then we redirect our energy into the new pattern, recommitting to that change.

As an example, I’ve recently started slipping back into old unwillingness to get out of bed. This is probably because I rushed the conditioning of my wake-up, rise-from-bed cues, and haven’t sufficiently released that old energy. 

This is an opportunity to do some “weeding”. I’ve noted it down, and now will revisit “tilling the soil”, holding space for that unwanted pattern to express and release. Having reaffirmed my divestment, I’ll again direct energy back into the state of gratitude I want to experience in the mornings. 

Weeding out any resproutings of the old pattern, then renourishing the growth of the new, is the basic goal of cultivation. It’s like weeding around a plant you’re growing, then watering it. You make sure the new pattern isn’t getting overgrown, and doesn’t lose energy to the old ones.   

With the feedback we receive, we’re able to tend our growth into this pattern and stabilize its actualization. Positive feedback gives us an opportunity to expand and reinforce our new patterns, while negative feedback indicates what further weeding there is to do.

The goal is to tend this pattern into a self-maintaining feedback loop. This should become the case when your belief-pattern is self-validating, and when you’re comfortable in the behavioral pattern. If you’re here, then you’ve successfully transitioned into a new default way-of-being. 

Once this happens, old patterns slowly fade from the brain. Unused neural pathways get marked for synaptic pruning, a process where the brain recycles cells that aren’t being used anymore. This further cements our transition into a new reality.

Keep up with cultivation until the pattern is stable, you’ve grown into it well, and it’s integrated as a stable feature of your life. This is possible with patient tending to our growth. Giving the pattern thorough time and care will result in a strong, lasting result. A well-conditioned pattern will unfold almost of its own accord.
