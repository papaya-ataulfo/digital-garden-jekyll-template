title: Seek validating experiences to weave in new beliefs

*Seeded July 15, 2021*

Seek validating experiences to help root/weave in new beliefs. New beliefs need to be wired to various points of reference in the brain, or they'll quickly fall away, get pruned. By seeking and experiencing things that validate a new belief, you both imbue it with some feeling of true-ness and also gain a reference point that helps stabilize it, such that a new schema can start to grow.

For example, if you're learning to enjoy doing pushups:
- Be affirming the belief, fx. "I can enjoy pushups!"
- Get some positive affect going, and do some pushups, wiring the two together
- Use this experience of enjoying pushups to validate the new belief!
