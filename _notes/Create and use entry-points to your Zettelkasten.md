title: Create and use entry-points to your Zettelkasten
---

*Seeded May 25, 2021*

Because a NET can get huge and dense (just look at graph view!), it's important to have clear places to jump in from. Otherwise, the sheer immensity of it can overwhelm you, disrupting your flow and hindering your work. Keep a good balance between structured and free-form knowledge stewardship.

Define entry-points as the "trailheads" from which to enter locales, regions - large clusters of nodes. They can be MOC-like, or simply the biggest/most relevant/salient/useful notes to start from. You can also use structure-notes, like indexes or TOCs, and full-text search to navigate. 

Then you can jump in, using these to quickly and easily access any area of your NET, from which you can [[Surf the web]].
