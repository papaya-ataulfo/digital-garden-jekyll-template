title: Beingness

*Seeded July 5, 2021*


Beingness is the total symphony of existing-actualizing-unfolding that a given being/human/entity is. It's an -ing word because [[We are process]], we are continuously becoming. We aren't static.

My intent here is to offer a way to refer to the self-in-motion, as an objective form of reality. I want to establish languaging that can scaffold a creative practice which takes the self as its form.

- Beingness as the ways in which one is continuously actualizing and unfolding as an expression of reality.
- This is starting to get at a way of describing/modeling and referring to the self as an active artwork - where this is the whole composition, the whole thing, and an [[Expression-of-being]] is a given feature, like a movement within the symphony.
