title: We learn from feedback

*Seeded August 20, 2021*

Feedback is how we learn about our environment and those we share it with.

[[By engaging with some Other, be it a deer or a person or a brick wall, you're entering into a relationship]]. Through that relationship you'll get some feedback through your senses, learning about that Other.

Getting that feedback and associating it with its object is how [[Our brains are continually modeling the world around us|the brain models the world around us]], thus is how we learn and expand our understanding. And those models then inform the choices we make, the ways in which we interpret, feel, and navigate our experiences.
