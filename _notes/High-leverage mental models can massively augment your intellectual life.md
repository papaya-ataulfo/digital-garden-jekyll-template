title: High-leverage mental models can massively augment your intellectual life
---

*Seeded July 25, 2021*

Just as there are meta-skills which can powerfully kickstart your life, there are also meta-mental-models (try saying that ten times fast :) ) - units of intellectual architecture which are very broadly useful. They're 80/20 models for your cognitive development.

My favorites, or maybe just the ones I happen to have acquired along my path, are:
- [[Yin-yang]], which is everywhere once you start seeing it;
- [[Compositionality]], which goes really well with [[Holarchy]], [[Heterarchy]], and [[Emergence]], [[Transcend and Include]]
- [[Feedback]], which is so key to our interrelational reality, and [[Feedback Loops]]
- [[1st, 2nd, 3rd person epistemics]], a brilliant way of delineating three important domains of understanding to cultivate
- [[Becomingness]], or, that reality is in-motion, in-the-making - this also relates to [[The Torch]] - [[Entropy has a dance partner]]
- [[Reality is pattern and nebulosity]], from David Chapman; that [[Reality is patterned]]
- [[Kegan's stages of development]]
