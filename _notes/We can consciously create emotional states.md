title: We can consciously create emotional states

*Seeded June 9, 2021*

Very simple: because [[visualizing an activity stimulates the same neural pathways as actual action|visualizing something activates corresponding neural circuitry]], we can visually feel-into an emotional state in order to vivify it in our actual experience.

It matters whether or not you've got strong neural growth for a given feeling - for example, if you've never really been the confident type, it'll take consistent visual rehearsal, over time, to generate confidence with much strength. 

When it comes down to it, [[visual practice gets you partway there]], and actual practice takes you the rest of the way - so don't forget to actually find opportunities to go experience that state, gain real-world reinforcement to support and grow into that new pattern.
