title: An index of trailheads üçÉ

From here, paths branch out towards the various areas of knowledge that I'm engaged in. At present there's two main subnetworks, accessible from below:
- Notes on Zettelkasten, PKM, etc., starts from [[Zettelkasten is an interconnection-based approach to managing thought]]
- Notes on [[Skill in growth enables a more skillful life|growth and development]], [[We're composed largely of patterns|habits and patterns]] 

I'm writing daily, updating weekly, with the intent to grow a rich network of knowledge around the areas of growth and development, knowledge work, self-authorship, and whatever else feels right to integrate.

<p>Below is a bird's-eye view of the notes in this network.</p>
