From here, paths branch out towards the various areas of knowledge that I'm engaged in. At present there's two main subnetworks, accessible from below:
- Notes on Zettelkasten, PKM, etc., starts from [[Zettelkasten is an interconnection-based approach to managing thought]]
- Notes on [[Skill in growth enables a more skillful life|growth and development]], [[We're composed largely of patterns|habits and patterns]]

<p>Below is a bird's-eye view of the notes in this network.</p>
