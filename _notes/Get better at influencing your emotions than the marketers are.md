*Seeded June 9, 2021*

[[Affective associations aren't set in stone|Feeling is a dynamic, fluid thing]], and at present most of us aren't great at affective self-regulation. But marketers know how to get under our skin, exploit our psychology, and happily do so.

[[Learn to self-regulate|Get good at regulating your own inner emotional dynamics]], so that you aren't so vulnerable to all the psychological exploitation that's going on today. If you can become more nonreactive to the exploitative strategies of the attention economy, you'll avoid becoming another plundered source of profit and can instead live more on your own terms.
