title: Order of operations matters, but not overridingly so

*Seeded August 4, 2021*

When it comes to development, order of operations is important. 

[[Start with the basics]] - in my view this is key, and I keep coming back to it. Strong, stable roots are always important. There's no shame in returning again and again to a basic meditative practice, to basic chords, to basic stances. And really, you can't get very far without basics. You can try, but it'll be messy.

Beyond the basics, it's up to us to find our own paths. Mindful awareness is key to numerous psychotechnologies and traditional pathways, yet some of us are drawn to hatha yoga while others prefer qi gong or tantra. None are really accessible without their shared fundamentals.

Life seems to unfold in just the right ways to challenge us, nudge us in the right directions. Often this has little regard for anyone's attempts to make good roadmaps. Trust, in the end, is what it always comes back to.
