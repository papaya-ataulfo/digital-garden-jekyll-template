title: Habits form according to feedback
---

*Seeded June 3, 2021*

This is the whole idea of the Habit Loop, as given by Duhigg and Clear. If a given behavior is followed by a reward - dopamine, etc. - that signals to the brain that it's a valuable action to repeat. This is how habits form: if A leads to B, and B is a desirable outcome,<!--[[We navigate reality on the basis of patterns]] --> the brain starts to learn that pattern.

Habits thus form according to feedback. Eat a wild berry and get sick? You won't eat it again. Try another, and it's great? Now you've learned a reliable pattern - feedback which remains consistent. Habits form when we invest in behaviors around these [[Reality is patterned|reliable patterns]].
