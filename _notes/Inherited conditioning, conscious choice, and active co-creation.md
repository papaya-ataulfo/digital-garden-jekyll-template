## Conscious choice, employed skillfully

I left off last time in the territory of conscious choice, and skillful use of it. Let’s continue down that way, see where it leads.

There’s two levels to consider, the first being present-moment, single-pattern, the second being ongoing, compound-patterns.

The first is seen by asking “am I aware of the pattern I’m in right now?” We often aren’t, partly because we so closely identify with our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that we think we _are_ them¹.

This is where conscious choice can become skillful. Are you living in a primarily reactive mode, or are you aware of the felt-sensations that are influencing your choices? In a mindful mode, choice is more truly ours.

Then, wield that choice: you can notice and interrupt patterns, if you choose to. This means catching yourself in the midst of it. Say, the onset of frustration with a frozen webpage. Notice how emotion arises. Recognize it as habitual, and choose to be nonreactive - sit and watch. It swells, soon fades, and you’re shortly in a better place.

Sitting with the emotion allows it to fully unfold and depart, and prevents reinforcement of the pattern. Released, space then opens, equilibrium returns, and you can reflect and move forward².

Say you react, instead. Frustrated emotion leads to frustrated thoughts and actions, creating a feedback loop. Reactivity feeds-back into the emotion, perpetuating your pain and your pattern³. The next time such a situation occurs, you’ll likely do the same.

Practicing mindfulness improves your capacity for nonreactivity. It brings clearer, steadier awareness, such that it’s easier to navigate the influence of habitual momentum. To start is simply to become aware of how you’re feeling.4

If this is possible with single patterns, can we do it with many? Can we shift patterns on a larger scale? Sure we can. We can consciously choose to redesign and shift many patterns, which, again, starts with awareness.

On the second level, consider the larger compositions of patterns that each of us inhabit. We all live through numerous habits of thought and action and feeling. There’s skill to be found here too, in reconditioning whole sets of habitual pathways.

You can change your present experience by interrupting one pattern. You change a greater degree of your experience, over time, by patiently shifting your overall composition of patterns.

Consider this: you take a month to recondition your patterns surrounding body image. Understanding your thoughts and feelings as habitual, you take the time to release pent-up emotion. Then, you choose more empowering associations, and practice those - literally focusing time and energy into growing the new neural pathways. Patiently tend to that new growth, and you’ll soon find yourself in a new place.

We can do this with a combination of visualization and simulation, intentionally using the brain’s innate capacities to generate and practices states of being. Then you can reassociate that feeling throughout your life. Sit, invoke positive feeling, and associate it with, say, your hair, your body, your self-trust.

Repeat, with energies chosen by you, for your relationship to exercise, to learning, to eating, to the internet, to consumption, and so on. We really have the ability to reshape our brains, and thus our experiences, too.

We all sort of do this, considering how popular habit building has become. It’s still rarer, though, to shift our habitual thoughts and feelings alongside the action-aspect of a habit. But it’s no less important - exercise, say, is unnecessarily harder if you try to form the habit but don’t address your unenthusiastic feelings and thoughts.

And what’s more - there’s good reason to take an honest look at the patterns you’re living through now.

## The impact of inherited conditioning

It’s probable that you didn’t consciously choose much of what’s conditioned into you. We’re exposed to all sorts of patterns as we grow up, and those become our inherited conditioning.

Inherited conditioning is all the things we receive from our culture, from history - attitudes towards people, towards meaning, towards life; notions of the nature of existence; beliefs about good and bad, right and wrong; myriad ways of acting and speaking and relating to the world.

Our brains are most malleable when we’re young, and thus we absorb all our ways of thinking and acting and feeling, of understanding and responding to experience, from parents and peers. Once we can think for ourselves, the opportunity arises to revise that inherited arrangement of patterns.

Why wouldn’t we want to do so? We don’t need to believe that what we inherit is any good for us, and it’s clear that many of us receive less-than-useful patterns. So why adhere to them?

There isn’t a real reason to. Some of what we get is fine - basic social etiquette, literacy, and so on - but a lot isn’t. Just considering the persistence of racism, sexism, and other forms of us-vs-them belief, it’s clear enough that history gives us many unuseful patterns.

Further, the patterns conditioned into us may not align well with who we each are, deeper inside. It’s rare to be raised in a fully supportive environment, to be consistently encouraged towards self-discovery, self-expression. More often than not, we’re told who and how to be.

And this shapes us, deeply so. Education, for example, schools us to have particular notions of teaching and learning, of studiousness and right behavior, of validity. It shapes our relationship with authority, and puts us through a uniform mold. Yet the values of institutionalized education don’t often reflect what is actually good or needed for any given individual.

No wonder so many of us become people acting parts where the heart’s not all there. No wonder inner life remains confused and stifled. Often we follow the path given and often find that it leads not towards but away from fulfillment, from self-expression, from creativity.

We don’t have to stick to that conditioning, though. We all have the right to rethink who we are, and to actualize that vision. Even if we can’t individually change the larger structures we’re squeezed through, we can change our own lives⁵.

Chances are, not everything needs change. There’s a ton of great information out there, and many of us succeed at positive growth. I’m just saying this to emphasize that we’re more pattern-defined than is commonly realized. There’s _a lot_ of potential for reshaping who and how we are, beyond the usual understanding of good habits.

And at all times we have choice, which enables us to shift our patterns. Not just to perform momentary interruptions, but to create large-scale change, as well.

Take a moment to ask yourself - _to what degree have I consciously chosen the patterns I live through? What have I inherited, disempowering or empowering or otherwise?_

The answers are different for each of us; this is only meant to spur some thinking.

## Why do we have such a hard time changing?

Established patterns tend to linger well into our lives - supposedly you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. That’s perhaps truer of ageing humans.

In part, this is a matter of momentum: we become biologically invested in patterns, in the actual neural growth that accrues over time. You can’t just _ctrl-z_ years worth of myelinated neurons. Without conscious effort to change them, patterns persist.

As we become objectively, biologically invested, we also become subjectively, psychologically invested. We come to identify with our ways of thinking and feeling and acting, believing that it's _really who we are. “I’m a morning person.” “I’m a coffee drinker.” “I’m a car person.” “I’m a reader.” “I’m an environmentalist".”_

In a sense, a person’s patterns describe them well. But they aren’t absolute - they’re just reflective of a current self, and self-hood is more fluid than we tend to notice. In truth, we’re very changeable, but our subjective experience feels constant, uninterrupted. That’s a funky dilemma to contend with.

Living through patterns and unaware of the space that can be found from them, we come to believe that we are them. Beliefs use self-sealing logic to reinforce themselves, and this often prevents openness to change⁶. As bias strengthens, we also become more entrenched in the ways of feeling and acting that those beliefs encourage.

Individual patterns compose the total sets we live through, and we each tend to identify with that sum-total. Investment in individual patterns builds up the momentum of the whole composition, and that momentum grows over time.

This is one way to characterize _ego_: as psychological and biological momentum which results in unquestioned identification with one’s patterns. It’s weird to think that much of our beingness is patterns with momentum, not consciously chosen, never really questioned.

The trick is to understand ourselves as fully real, yet unbeholden to existing patterns. We are _consciousness,_ more than we are any present patterns-of-being that consciousness is experiencing. Then, from clearer consciousness, we can _audit_ our patterns and recreate our-selves.

You aren’t obligated to be the person you were yesterday, a week ago, a month ago, or last year. That person emerges from the patterns that compose them, and a new iteration - a new experience - emerges from new patterns.

There’s no strict rule anywhere that says we’re required to continue running along the same grooves as always. Though momentum inclines us to, though we deeply identify with them, we can still shift our patterns to a large degree. And there’s a lot of benefit to being more flexible with who and how you are.

## We can actively shape our lives

Your patterns give rise to your experience of life. Right now and going forward, they are your _present_ experience and they shape the _direction_ you take. It follows that to change them is to change your experience.

For these reasons it’s essential that we’re conscious of our patterns, aware of their origins, and satisfied with their design.

That we can change our lives is a reality, not wishful thinking. Experience is ultimately mediated by the brain, and we can reshape the brain⁷. It’s neuroplastic, and responds to changes in how we use our energy. Patterns are tangible, incarnate neural realities. Current patterns have grown and reinforced, but can be released and recreated.

With the right techniques, we can create new patterns. The most familiar form of this - habit building - tends to focus on behavioral change, but we can change more than just our behaviors. We can also change how we habitually think and feel.

The right practices enable us to shape patterns more skillfully than yet we can. A focused skillset for this purpose will empower us to take a more active role in creating our lives. We are creators, of our own lives at the least.

The whole “we create our realities”-thing is often said without much real support, so I won’t repeat it without explanation. It’s my goal to show you how this is so (and when/where it isn’t), with the appropriate nuance and detail.

We don’t _control_ things outright - many forces are beyond control, such that our ability to shape our lives is much like sailing. You have to go with it; you can’t push reality around.

To **actively create our lives** is _the_ thing to do. It’s the only thing to do, if we want to find fulfillment, find meaning, live lives that resonate with us. To do so starts with awareness and understanding of our patterns, and heads toward a skillful approach to shaping them.

Divest from old patterns, and they cease to influence your life. Invest in new patterns, and you begin to shape a new experience.

—Notes—

1: We aren’t just patterns, though. Through cultivation of consciousness, it becomes clearer that we experience our patterns but aren’t strictly defineable _as_ them. Another place to see this is in addiction, or compulsion - you may have had the experience of watching yourself carry out a behavior that you consciously didn’t want to follow through with.

2: This is true of my own experience, though I’m not the originator of the idea. Mindfulness as a method for processing felt-sensation is how I interpret what people mean when they say “honor your feelings” or “surrender”. The book I originally got this from is _[Letting Go](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16098910-letting-go)_ by David Hawkins (though I suspend judgement on much he says beyond the basic technique). To me, this is an innate capacity of the mind - presence, calm awareness, mindfulness, whatever you want to call it - and can be applied in various ways.

3: Dave Gray talks about “doom loops” in _[Liminal Thinking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30197119-liminal-thinking?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=gfaFvNXeTz&rank=1)_. You can probably also notice these in yourself, if you tend to react to stressed emotions with further stress.

4: Mindfulness/meditation/etc. have acquired a reputation as being _Extremely Difficult_ to do, but I have to disagree with that on these grounds: believing that something is difficult serves mainly to ward off and weaken our efforts to do something. You’re predisposing yourself to struggle. Instead we could frame things as _effortful_, as _requiring exertion and commitment_. And we could practice a loving relationship with effort, such that we’re more inclined to continue to do such things.

5: And maybe we can change the larger structures of the world, too, especially as we’re heading towards a very change-inviting era. That, though, is a collective effort rather than an individual one - all the more reason to organize, to form communities, to grow towards new ways of existing.

6: This is also discussed in _Liminal Thinking_ (linked above).

7: [Here](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/np/2014/541870/) is an interesting paper discussing neuroplasticity & neurogenesis in more detail than I could ever give.
