title: Life isn't just about getting somewhere

*Seeded July 21, 2021*

This came up for me here and now because I had the usual "wow, this is going well - I'll be there in no time!" kind of thought, and... well, shit, life isn't always about that. Arrivals are nice, sure. Milestones are really satisfying to reach. Results are wonderful. But what's the point if you can't enjoy the present moment? 

If you reach some big goal, but you're unable to slow down and actually enjoy the experience, what's the point? If you can't learn to [[Be present and go-with with life]] *now*, then you won't be able to do it when later is now.

So, for example: writing all this stuff isn't about finishing it. It's about the doing itself. It's about the music that always *is*, always is unfolding. This is somthing I'm continually returning to, seeing as mindfulness, and mindful becoming, have a pretty steep learning curve.
