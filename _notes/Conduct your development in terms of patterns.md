title: Conduct your development in terms of patterns
---

*Seeded June 3, 2021*

Because [[We grow upon patterns]], it makes sense to conduct your overall development by expanding and elaborating your vocabulary of patterns. 

Each pattern you learn - be it a simple habit, a deeper practice, or a component of a larger skill - contributes to the set of expressions you're able to articulate. <!--([[Imagine the self as a creative-expressive form]])--> As you expand that repertoire of pattern-competencies, you're building yourself up as a more skillful person. 

The more well-developed the repertoire of patterns you're able to express - from morning routines to empathy to the set of meals you can cook - the greater your depth and range of expression. <!--([[Balance depth and range]])--> 

If you can fluently articulate yourself in domains from personal productivity to physical health to skillful cooking, you're certainly developing as a person. Add to your patterns and you're adding to your development.
