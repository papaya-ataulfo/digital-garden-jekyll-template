# Composition
Composition is where we create a new pattern, crafting an intentional structure of thinking, feeling, and acting. We’ll choose a felt-state and belief-pattern to weave together, then lay out a behavioral pattern. Later, these are rehearsed into an integrated way-of-being.

To do this, we combine our creative senses with a bit of research. Good models of habits can provide workable starting points, while we ourselves know how best to reshape those to our needs.

Composing a pattern is similar to composing a piece of writing.* It moves from a brainstorm to an initial outline, then is fleshed-out by exploration and refinement of each “chunk” or element of the composition. This yields well-formed patterns, and gives us the opportunity to tune them to our wants and needs.

There’s a balance to strike here between the organic, bottom-up approach, and the organized, top-down approach. Playful, curious exploration allows us to personalize and bring life to this new way-of-being, while iterative refinements ensure we end up with a viable change to make. 

## Refocusing your intent
After tilling the soil, you should have a clearer idea of the new patterns you want to create. Now take any notes you might’ve made, plus the original vision you found, and refocus your intent. Revisit your goals, updating and adjusting them if you feel to.

Also re-energize your vision, sensing into that change with your mind’s-eye. This again gives clearer focus on the change you want to create, and it’s often very motivating to see that potential successfully actualized. You might also seek tangible imagery that helps triangulate your goal, doing something like a vision board.

So - make your goals tangible, and energize them as best you can. Feel free to use the above techniques, or whatever else works best for you.

# Composing the “vibe” or state of a pattern through intentional choice of felt-state and belief
We start composition by laying out the patterns of thinking and feeling we want to grow into. These form a mutually reinforcing feedback loop, where each spurs on the other. This loop then functions to support growth into a new behavior, as well. 

Doing this yields the “vibe” of this composition - the state of mind and energy with which we imbue a pattern.

## Shaping our patterns of feeling
Because feeling motivates our choices, thus our ways-of-being, it makes sense to give attention to the felt-dimension of a pattern. How do you actually want to feel when performing this habit? You can make that real, because we humans have this really cool ability to influence our states of feeling.

In phase one, we released some pattern of feeling with mindful awareness. We can also consciously generate feeling, using mind and body, and practice holding it as a state. Some theater traditions train actors in this capacity**, so that they can imbue their acting with genuine emotion. We can do this for off-stage ways-of-being, too. 

If we create and hold a felt-state, while visualizing or practicing patterns of thought and behavior, we’ll wire them together.*** The more we rehearse this connection, the more strongly that feeling integrates and becomes the default state we experience while in that pattern. 

This, combined with the ability to mindfully divest from patterns of feeling, means we have a good deal of influence over our felt-states. Which is incredibly useful - by selecting and deselecting the attunements of feeling that we want to experience, we can reshape the emotional dimension of our patterns.

## Thought-patterns, beliefs, possibility
Feeling is tied into our schemas. A schema is a mental model, a web of notions about some domain of life. From your schema of some context flows the habitual thoughtspace you’ll experience while in that context. Some of these thought-patterns are strongly imbued with feeling - we call these beliefs. 

Beliefs tend to function as habitual narratives through which we live. A structure of beliefs tells a story - “man, exercise is so hard. And I’ve never managed to keep up a routine. I just can’t do it.” Each of these thought-patterns carries feeling, here a sense of certain failure. When this person goes to exercise, those patterns will arise as their default way of relating to that activity. 

This creates a self-reinforcing feedback loop. De-energizing thoughts and feelings activate before failure has even occured, which just guarantees it’ll happen. When it does, that belief in failure is reinforced. A belief can thus self-perpetuate, obtaining new validation each time its self-fulfilling prophecy comes true.**** Without conscious attention, these beliefs likely won’t change of their own accord.

Beliefs work a bit like doors, opening or closing various possibility-spaces. A belief that you could never successfully play an instrument only guarantees that door stays closed, while a belief that you could opens it up. They don’t make anything happen of their own accord, but they do shape how open or closed we are to possibility.

## Changing our beliefs 
It makes sense, then, to change our habitually-told stories in accordance with any behavioral change. Crafting beliefs which support and accompany behavioral change is an essential part of making real change to our patterns. 

Mindful self-inquiry, like that performed in phase one, allows us to loosen felt-attachment to and disidentify from beliefs. Then we can create, affirm, and, by consciously generating feeling, vivify new, intentionally chosen replacements.

Beliefs are actually pretty fluid. They don’t seem that way when you’re in the thick of it, and because they often self-reinforce, they can feel pretty permanent. But it helps to remember that none of us are born with beliefs. They’re things we acquire over the course of our lives, conditioning that arises relative to the narrow, limited life paths we each take through the ocean of possible experience. 

Instead of being absolute, unchangeable facts, try thinking of beliefs as possible ways in which we can be attuned to the experiencing of something. By changing the thoughts and feelings we habitually attune to, we can consciously choose which doors are open to us, and which are closed.*****

With each change in behavior, we have the opportunity to write and bring to life a new story. As we successfully grow into new patterns, we’ll validate that story. Gradually it can expand and replace the old schema, supporting our potential and our growth. 

## Writing out the “vibe” or state of the new pattern
The “vibe” or state of this pattern is the quality of energy you bring to it, which comes from your thinking and feeling. It’s the version of you that shows up and becomes real by living in this new way. We start our composition by finding and energizing that new quality of being, sketching out new belief and feeling to imbue it with.

With your intent refocused and space cleared from phase one, you may already have a good sense of what these are. Feeling into your vision again can also really help to get a sense for how you want to show up in this pattern. What follows below is a few things I use to choose this.

## Some ways to choose/find new patterns
One of my standard ways of choosing new belief and feeling is to reframe old, disempowering patterns in a more empowering way. I take the mindmap of my schema from phase one, discern which old belief exerted the most influence, and reverse it, writing out a personal affirmation which supports my growth. 

“Man, yoga is so tedious” might become “Yoga is an amazing opportunity to cultivate patience”; “Staying consistent is impossible” might become “I’m fully capable of being consistent”, and so on. These new beliefs become stories to vivify and expand as you grow.

Thinking of beliefs as stories, consider what story you may want to bring to life. This is an opportunity to be playful, exploring different roles or characters you might take on in various areas of your life. How might your experience be enlivened, if, say, you invoke the energy of an ancestor-warrior during your workouts? Or if you invoke the energy of your favorite performers while practicing music? 

Doing this might feel a bit like a silly LARP at first, but sticking with it will integrate that energy as an aspect of you. You can expand your identity to include qualities of being, “vibes”, that you may not currently be actualizing. And as you grow into these, they become part of who you are. This is an awesome opportunity to consider what new energies you want to bring into your life. 

For example - in yoga, I really benefit from doing a half-serious internal LARP as a yoga teacher. Talking myself calmly through the poses keeps me focused and relaxed, and makes the experience more enjoyable. It feels truer to me, to where I’d actually like to have my mind and energy when doing yoga. Putting on a role like this is great way to personalize and enliven your experience of some pattern, and in time integrates as part of who you are.

## Make it tangible
Once you’ve felt-into, envisioned, located this energy - make it tangible. For starters, write it down, articulating a belief and felt-state, wording it however feels right to you. You can also look to capture it with imagery, doing something like a vision board, or a simply finding an image that resonates. I don’t draw, but I imagine that might allow for an even more accurate, personalized representation.

As we envision and make tangible this intent, we’re “seeding” it, starting up new neural growth. By patiently rehearsing these new patterns, we condition the new pathways of thinking and feeling, encouraging them to become our defaults. 

Once written out, belief and felt-state are placed at the beginning of the composition. Later they’ll be rehearsed, conditioning this joint mind-energy pattern to arise naturally. That’s it - we’ve now sketched out the “vibe” or state of this composition.

# Crafting a behavioral pattern
The next step is to craft a behavioral pattern. This is usually best made from a combination of research and our own creative senses. You can look online or to other people for good habit-models, and tap your intuition to shape things for your own needs. Blend these however works best for you.

## Modeling behaviors as compositions
To model a behavior as a composition, we chunk it down into distinct actions which, performed in sequence, form the whole. These action-segments are like the “bars” in a musical composition. 
 
They should be a middling level of specificity, because they’re meant to serve as the “skeleton” of the composition, a functional structure which we’ll vivify in rehearsal. Think “get up from bed”, “take a sip of water”, as opposed to “open my eyes”, “move my left leg”, “pick up my pencil”. 

These actions, and the sequence they form, are the basic pathway this behavior takes. A morning routine might be ‘cue:alarm, get up from bed, sip my water, get dressed, neaten my bedside, do morning hygiene, go for a short walk, return and meditate for 10min, do a morning journal entry, end.’ A shorter sequence could be ‘cue:sit at my desk, open my journal, date an entry, write morning pages, end.’

Leave out all the minutiae which can be taken for granted, like opening doors, breathing, and specific mechanics of movement. These action-segments are simply “bones” upon which we’ll rehearse and cultivate more lively, expressive ways-of-being. It just doesn’t make sense to try to mastermind all the expressive-details that you can simply develop in actual practice, later on.

## Putting it into practice
It’s good to start by getting a sense for your own ideas before you seek external answers. Chances are, you've got most of the answers you need. With a brainstorm, a mindmap, or your own favorite technique, explore and gather these ideas. Afterwards, feel free to look for existing habit-models to further inform yourself.

From this brainstorming, we sketch out an outline of the behavior - picking the main nodes of action and putting them in-sequence. Here it’s often useful to visualize, imagining yourself carrying out this behavior and noting down the phases of action through which the behavior travels.

With this sketch made, it’s time to head into the pattern, doing a sort of pre-rehearsal. The aim is to carry it out with a light, explorative mindset, looking to see how your sketch actually plays out. This should illuminate any needed changes -  things like environmental set-up, or aspects of the sequence of action you didn’t previously think of. 

For example, you might plan a morning routine which includes sipping water when you wake up - so you need to put that water in place the night before. There usually aren’t too many of these to add, if your first sketch was thorough. 

Take this feedback to your composition and refine the initial sketch with what you now know. If needed, pass through this cycle of exploration and adjustment once or twice more, until you’re confident in your pattern. 

Further explorations are also an opportunity to take on the “vibe” you planned and see how it feels with the behavior. Invoke that energy, affirming your beliefs and visualizing your intent to bring it forth in you, and then flow through the behavior. This starts to integrate them, and familiarizes you further with the pattern you’ll soon actualize. Again, take any feedback and reshape your composition accordingly.

What we’re doing in this process is “clearing the trail” ahead of time.****** We take the time to shape a coherent, well-formed pathway, such that when it comes time to perform this habit, we know exactly what to do. By planning and rehearsing, we start to grow corresponding neural pathways before ever performing the habit. This reduces cognitive load in-moment, making the subjective experience of habituation a good deal smoother. 

With this behavioral pattern well-set, you’ve created the “flow” of the composition. In rehearsal, we’ll combine these structural mechanics with the “vibe”, integrating function and energy. Together vibe and flow are what you're doing and how you're doing it, how you’re acting and the quality of energy you bring to that. 

Next we’ll move into rehearsal, where we can vivify the pattern, adding more feeling and nuance, and further grow into it.


* This is at least true of how I go about doing this. I’m curious to see what you guys think, and what additional knowledge/insights might be offered about composition. I’ll be the first to admit that I’m a pretty pragmatically-inclined person, and I get the sense this process reflects that - though there’s plenty of room in rehearsal to add more expressiveness. 
Apparently Renaissance painters did a lot of planning, sketching, outlining before they executed a final painting - so maybe the persistent myth of artists as spontaneously brilliant creators is just that, a myth. And planning is just part of creating great things :)

**** Put another way, your beliefs bias you to experience and re-experience things through their particular frames. They pre-attune you to perceive, interpret, and respond to something accord to their content. A belief like “All people are fundamentally bad” causes you to project that bias on everyone you meet, regardless of the actual reality.

*****  It’s a really interesting experience to change a belief. When I was reshaping my relationship with exercise, I had to release beliefs like “God this is so fucking tedious; I can’t keep this up”. I replaced them with contradictory beliefs - “I can commit to lifelong fitness; I can enjoy exercise!” and when I brought those to life, it was a bit of a shock. Like what the fuck, I can just change my experience like this? Apparently so. Could be because until I started doing this, my patterns of mind and energy just seemed set in stone, so when I changed one in a way that felt real, it was a genuine surprise. 

****** With a typical habits approach, there’s no attention given to “clearing the trail” before you set out to form the habit. So when you’re in the habituation process, you’re trying to figure the structure of the habit and do it consistently at the same time. 
In this approach, we do one at a time, reducing the energy needed for each part and thus easing the process. I’ve thought of this as separating myelination/neural conditioning from habituation: first you plan and develop some new capacity of thinking-feeling-acting, then you grow it into your life as a habit. It doesn’t make habituation easy, but it’s a better distribution of energy/efforts.
