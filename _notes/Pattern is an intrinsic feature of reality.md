I’ve come to see pattern and nonpattern as two features of reality which appear to underlie much of the rest of it.

I’m using “pattern” to mean _regularity (of form)_, and “nonpattern” as the contrasting _irregularity_. Consider pure pattern as one end of a spectrum, and pure nonpattern as the other. Actual reality arises between and through the two.

Understanding these is important, because we a) navigate reality on the basis of patterns, and b) should align our views with intrinsic uncertainty, for a healthier relationship with reality.

# Intrinsic features of reality

So let’s consider pattern and nonpattern as features of our reality. This may or may not seem like a bold claim. Either way, it’s visible everywhere - the two permeate reality from micro to macro, from the soil to the cosmos¹. Look around you and both are there.

I’m wearing a sweater as I write this, which is held together by a regular knit pattern, the yarn looped into and around itself again and again. Yet irregularity abounds as well, the wool fraying and pilling and folding with less-discernible form. Here pattern and nonpattern are present simultaneously, together giving rise to the shape of the clothing.

The two exist relative to one another - pattern necessarily goes-with nonpattern, and nonpattern with pattern. Each implies the other, just as black implies white and self implies other.

Try to imagine a mountain with a front side, but no back. Even if the mountain were entirely inverted and one atom thick, it’d still have both. Try to imagine a wave with a crest but no trough - it simply never occurs.

This is derivative of yin-yang, which is an incredibly useful mental model. Reality appears to be dualistic, and we understand it through apparent contrasts. But what seems explicitly two is implicitly one:

> _“You and everything you call “other” are explicitly different. But since you **always find these two aspects of experience together** there’s a kind of something fishy about it. That isn’t noticed, that’s been overlooked. And that is that they’re implicitly one.” -Alan Watts_

Two sides of the same coin, or two poles of a magnet. Slice the coin down the middle to take off the back, and it’s still got back and front. Cut the magnet in half, it’ll still have both poles². They go together, and can’t exist separately³.

Just so with pattern and nonpattern. They appear to be fundamental features of this reality - regularity of form, irregularity of form; predictable or not-so; ordered or chaotic. Try to think of something in which they play no role, and let me know!

Now to characterize each a bit further. This isn’t an exhaustive discussion - it’s simply an effort to set out from the trailhead of understanding.

## Pattern as structure, consistency, order

Pattern is a familiar phenomenon. It’s visible in the cycling of seasons, in the flow of day to night. It’s present in our daily routines, and in every breath we take. From micro to macro, in the spiral of a flower’s bloom and the spiral of the Milky Way, in the arc of a day and the arc of a life - pattern is everywhere. It’s in both the cycling of things and the ordered arrangement of form - both are types of regularity.

Pattern gives order and structure. Consider a molecule of water: it’s an ordered arrangement of energy, which is consistent from one molecule to the next, across space and time. That regular form can be called a pattern, as if there were a template from which all H2O arises.

Consider the cycling of the trade winds. They follow a path across the Earth, consistent within a range from year to year. It’s a structure of sorts, a regular pattern of energy which repeats in space and time. You might say the same about rivers, the water cycles, ocean currents, human traffic patterns, and so on.

Energy takes many different forms. Just as a molecule or a river is a consistent arrangement of energy, so too is a human being. We are complex patterns, energy ordered into biological forms.

> _“What we observe as material bodies and forces are nothing but shapes and variations in the structure of space. Particles are just appearances.” -Erwin Schrodinger._

Yet pattern is not exact, not absolute - rather, it’s consistent, sometimes with slight variation within a stable range. Simpler forms are more stable - some particles persist near indefinitely - while more complex forms are less so - modern humans can persist for around 70-90 years, sometimes much less.

So let’s call pattern that which has consistent, regular form and which repeats in space-time.

## Nonpattern as uncertainty, entropy, irregularity

With pattern comes nonpattern (or [nebulosity](https://meaningness.com/nebulosity)). This is the element of uncertainty, of nondefiniteness. Where pattern gives us order, nonpattern brings the disintegrative forces of entropy, chaos.

Winter always returns, but we can’t say precisely when it begins, nor when it ends. The flow of the seasons is not a definite thing. It patterns, but is also characterized by nebulous transitions of temperature and weather, varying from year to year. This uncertainty is nonpattern.

Nonpattern also suggests entropy. Entropy, the dominant force that’s said to be slowly grinding everything down to dust. _Order always decays to simpler, more probable states._ We see this all around us - trees die and decay, civilizations rise and fall. Nothing lasts forever, and complex order tends to crumble spectacularly.

> _“The world given to us by physics is unrelievedly bleak… supernovae, asteroid impacts… Epidemics, stroke… all are random movement away from the narrowly organized set of states that we value, into increasing disorder. -John Tooby_

These aspects of nonpattern, uncertainty and entropy, are always present. All of us experience things that we simply couldn’t see coming, and experience our lives tending towards disorder. These are challenging forces to navigate, and can produce some of the best and worst parts of life.

Let’s call nonpattern that which lacks discernible form and which counteracts the opposing tendency to order.

### Some reframings

It’s useful to reframe uncertainty & entropy in a positive light. Consider uncertainty as that which makes life interesting. As the outcome of a competition - soccer, chess - becomes clear, the game loses interest. The uncertainty of outcome makes the game worth playing, and does so too for life. If all were known and easily obtainable, living would soon lose much of its appeal.

Consider entropy as that which enables the human drives to create things and to cohere our experiences. That entropy exists at all is how we may order and reorder our lives. If there were no decay, growth would lose its meaning. A fuller reality emerges in the exchange between both order and disorder.

And what’s more, there is actually quite a lot of incredible pattern, harmonious order, all over the place. The assertion that energy tends to disorder holds in closed systems, but the universe sure looks like it’s evolving. Complexity and novelty are abundant and expanding at an incredible pace here on Earth. That should suggest that maybe entropy isn’t the dominant player, after all.

## Evolving complexity

So pattern and nebulosity are constantly interacting, and this dance seems to produce complexity. The universe was far simpler at the start, and grew exponentially more complex as time went on⁴. More complex order seems to still be emerging.

_Complexity appears to be _evolving,_ with new forms of reality arising through the interplay of pattern and nonpattern, harmony and disharmony.

Consistent, ordered forms - take molecules of water again - enable complexity to arise. Clouds, raindrops, and puddles all depend on the underlying pattern of a molecule of water. Simpler patterns underlie more complex patterns.

Then disorder contributes by putting ordered forms through stress tests. Disintegrative forces - entropy, chaos - stress pattern-forms, which either break down or persist. Resilient patterns remain, and somehow respond to stress with adaptation. This is what’s happening with biological life, at least⁵. Could it be [happening elsewhere,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNxSSNEO39U) too?

This stress testing prevents stagnation, and evolves energetic forms by catalyzing adaptation. If some form isn’t subject to stress testing, it becomes stagnant and weak. Consider us humans - with basic survival needs met, many can simply dodge the growth-catalyzing stress of physical exertion. We can become unresilient blobs, if we want to, and then we’ll be helpless when that level of security inevitably crumbles.

Energy itself is conserved, disintegrating and reintegrating through phases of stability and phases of instability. The _forms_ are what come and go. When it takes stable form, we call it a _thing_ like a cat, and when it’s unstable it’s harder to pin down. “The atmosphere” is not a particularly precise word for all the varieties of gaseous energy in flux up there.

Reality is this continuous, seamlessly fluctuating ocean of energy, moving from one arrangement of form to the next, many disparate elements coordinated in symphony, pattern dancing with nonpattern⁶. And it can’t really be perfectly labelled by words.

> _“Everything is the way it is because it got that way.” - D’arcy Wentworth Thompson_

My hunch is that nonpattern is also pattern, and it just appears disordered on the level of magnification we live at. Zoom far enough into human skin and you wouldn’t be able to guess the whole pattern, experiencing it just at that level. So much of what seems like chaos and nonorder may be part of patterns larger and longer than our lives, our world. Who knows if we’ll ever parse it all…

_This account makes sense to me in a metaphysical light, but seems fuzzier from the standpoint of physics_⁷_. Some say the universe is cyclic, which may fit with yin-yang. There’s plenty of other theories, too. There’s so much we simply don’t understand, and I sense it’s impossible to obtain absolute, fixed answers._

> _“Inexactness undermines scientific determinism, implying that human knowledge about the world is always incomplete, uncertain, and highly contingent.” - Satyajit Das_

_This is one of the challenges we need to live with - you can’t really know, perfectly and absolutely. Our knowledge is constantly evolving, reaching new bumps in the road, dancing with brief flashes of clarity, heading back into the fog. There’s a now-you-see-it, now-you-don’t nature to things, and it simply can’t be pinned down._

—Notes—

1: Examples of pattern and nonpattern: the circulation of blood, the veins themselves; yearly regrowth of plants and animals; fluctuation in the size of waves crashing on the shore, yet waves continue crashing; you & I have habits of speech but don’t say the exact same things every time; and so on.

2: Start looking for these pairs and you’ll notice them everywhere. The one that really clicked with me was to consider space and solid - I couldn’t be sitting in this room, a relatively solid being, without relatively unsolid stuff all around me. You need negative space to make out the figure.

3: Listen to [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_oYLq7_oPg) for a far more thorough discussion of yin-yang.

4: _“Our baby universe grew like a baby human - literally… it repeatedly doubled its size until it was more massive than our entire observable universe.” -_ Max Tegmark, associate professor of physics, MIT, from _This Explains Everything._ With this increase in size there’s also been an increase in complexity, also like a human baby. Maybe the universe is better thought of as a sort of supermassive organism?

5: An example of entropy interacting with order to produce complexity lies in biological systems. Many forms of life have evolved to harness entropy, using it to stabilize order. From “Falling into Place: Entropy and the Desperate Ingenuity of Life” in _This Explains Everything,_ from Edge. _“Entropy makes things fall, but life ingeniously rigs the game so that when they do, they often fall into place.”_ \- John Tooby

6: Binary computing demonstrates that incredible complexity can arise from a simple yes-or-no function, repeated combinatorially as necessary. Our whole digital world arises from binary. Pattern and nonpattern have a binary, polar relationship as well. Maybe reality is some sort of binary, nonlinear informational field.
