title: We grow upon patterns

*Seeded June 3, 2021*

Patterns are the best way to grow, perhaps the only way, because we need to make substantial investments to, at least on one level, achieve neurophysiological growth which corresponds to a meaningful change in our abilities.

Without consistent commitment to development of brain and body, as we adapt behaviorally and psychologically to some new way-of-being, we simply won't fully retain that growth. [[Use it or lose it]]; it needs to become a regularity in order to stick.
