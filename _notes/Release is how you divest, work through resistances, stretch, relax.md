title: Release is how you divest, work through resistances, stretch, relax

*Seeded August 2, 2021*

What I've come to call "release" is the state of awareness which complements [[Focus is how you invest, wield, concentrate your energy|focus]]. It's that place you start to find when a meditation session is deepening, and periods of wordless presence grow a bit longer.

This is simply *[[going with it]]*; declining to judge, grasp, or get hooked by internal or external stimuli, you melt into the flow of experience. This is the zooming out, the loosening, the breathing-out complement to focus' zooming in, tightening, breathing in. Getting into relationship with this dynamic is key to skillfully managing your attention, and your daily rhythms of energy.

I've found that having [[at least a very basic capacity to come to presence is an incredibly high-leverage skill]], better enabling you to stretch, to relax, to listen, to hold space, and, key for habit-shaping, to [[divest from existing habit-loops]].
