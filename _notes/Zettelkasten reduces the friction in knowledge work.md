title: Zettelkasten reduces the friction in knowledge work

*Seeded May 28, 2021*

Skillful use of a NET eases the efforts of knowledge work in a number of ways. Essentially, it makes it easier to perform a number of important, recurring tasks which are central to knowledge work, and which can be more difficult without such a system.

At its core, this is because [[A NET grows upon atomic notes]] - simple units of thought, singular articulations of ideas. Having atomic notes as our basic operational unit makes everything else a good deal easier.

**Here's a quick run-down of some of the benefits:**
- Because it's relatively easy to write a single note, [[Consistent Zetteling makes it possible to get to know what you actually think]]. It allows you to get all your existing models made clear and tangible and accessible. 
- Then, [[Zetteling enables us to develop our thinking over time]]. It gives you a living body of thought that you can continually revisit, iterate, expand, improve. 
- [[A Zettelkasten is a home-system with which to integrate your practices for intake and output of information]] - what you're learning and what you're producing can both live in tandem with your NET, and that NET can host all sorts of other tools and practices to enhance your learning and producing.
- [[A Zettelkasten is a highly accessible body of thought]], so you can find any thought or idea whenever you need it. 
- Also, [[Interconnected notes encourage the serendipitous emergence of insights]]. You can follow your intuition as new connections arise, and graph view also helps. Notes from all over time and space can be brought together in novel thinking.
- [[A Zettelkasten makes it easier to outline writing]]. You can pull existing notes to an outline, then rearticulate them in that context - relegating the blank page to the far easier task of writing single notes.
