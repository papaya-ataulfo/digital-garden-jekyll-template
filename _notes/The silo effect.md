## The silo effect

The silo effect in note-taking is when notes continually build up in a linear fashion, creating a larger and larger backlog of thinking. 

This phenomenon is exemplified by analog journal -based notes - each page turned buries earlier thinking, both physically and under the progression of time. This makes it difficult to find older thoughts, which are not necessarily less useful.

Physical journals also lack full-text search, which can help allay siloing ([[Zettelkasten sidesteps the silo effect]]).

When compared to using a NET, the silo effect makes journals an inefficient or suboptimal choice for knowledge work. It can also cause a number of undesirable stresses and other problems.
