title: The silo effect
---

*Seeded May 26, 2021*

The silo effect in note-taking is when notes continually build up in a linear fashion, creating a larger and larger backlog of thinking. 

This phenomenon is exemplified by analog journal -based notes - [[Note build-up with journaling produces an unuseful silo of thought|each page turned buries earlier thinking]], both physically and under the progression of time. This makes it difficult to find older thoughts, which are not necessarily less useful.

Physical journals also lack full-text search, which can help allay siloing.

[[Zettelkasten sidesteps the silo effect|When compared to using a Zettelkasten/NET]], the silo effect makes journals an inefficient, suboptimal choice for knowledge work. It can also cause a number of undesirable stresses and other problems (e.g., the anxiety and overwhelm of constantly feeling like you're losing ideas).
