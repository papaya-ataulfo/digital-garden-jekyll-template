title: Way-of-expressing

*Seeded July 7, 2021*

Think of expressions as "acts" or performances that you have in your repertoire. Most of ours are unconscious, inherited. The idea is that we can intentionally craft these, reshape existing ones, develop complex repertoires of patterns we're able to express through, and thus learn to skillfully/fluently live, navigate, grow!
