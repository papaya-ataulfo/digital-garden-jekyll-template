title: Skill in growth enables a more skillful life

*Seeded May 31, 2021*

Imagine that you want to learn to play the piano. You'll find a million and one people who'll teach you, all in their own ways. But if you just know how to [[Learn to direct your own unfolding becomingness|skillfully direct your own growth]], then the path is up to you.

Learn to do so, and any other skill, capacity, whatever, is yours to develop. If you've got a robust skillset for the precise targeting, nourishing, and directing of your growth, in brain and body, psychoemotionally and behaviorally, you'll be able to develop all the habits, practices, and skills you seek. <!-- ([[Skill in growth enables self-directed skill-acquisition]]). -->

You'll also waste less time with context-bound methods. Instead, you can adapt your understanding of growth to chart your own course through whatever self-shaping endeavors you set out on <!--([[All systems are limited]], [[Adapt your own approaches]]).-->

If you can't direct one day of conscious action, how can you direct your life? <!--([[Start with the basics]])--> If you can't consciously invest in one week of growth <!--([[Execute on small plans before you attempt larger ones]])-->, how can you become the person you seek to be?
