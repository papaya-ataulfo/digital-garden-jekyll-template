## Note build-up with journaling produces an unuseful silo of thought

When using a journal to capture ideas and take notes, that thinking builds up in a poorly-accessible silo ([[The silo effect]]). Each page turned buries earlier thinking, under paper and under the passage of time.

This body of thought is impossible to search (unless it's digital), and has no features which allow for the connection of ideas had at different times. You just have a big stack of ideas, instead of an interconnected ecology of thought. 

It's an arduous task to migrate linearly captured notes to a more fluid system, like a Zettelkasten/NET - but it's worth it. Also, journaling does have it's uses.
