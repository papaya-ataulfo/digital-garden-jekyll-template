title: Note build-up with journaling produces an unuseful silo of thought
---

*Seeded May 26, 2021*

When using a journal to capture ideas and take notes, that thinking builds up in a [[The silo effect|poorly-accessible silo]]. Each page turned buries earlier thinking, under paper and under the passage of time.

Such a build-up of thought is tedious to search through (unless it's digital), and has no features which allow for the connection of ideas had at different times. You just have a big stack of ideas, instead of an interconnected ecology of thought. 

It's an arduous task to migrate linearly captured notes to a more fluid system, like a Zettelkasten/NET - but it's worth it. Also, [[journaling does have its uses]].
