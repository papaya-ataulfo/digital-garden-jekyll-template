“Tilling the soil” is a self-inquiry technique used to heal and release undesired habits of thought and feeling. This clears spaces for the creation of new patterns, and the energy and feedback we gain begins to illuminate how that change wants to arise. 
 
Habits of thought and feeling already exist relative to any aspect of our lives, meaning no pattern-space starts as a blank slate. These present patterns can be inquired into and divested from, slowing their momentum so that they don’t hinder new growth. This is done by interacting with old patterns on the level of feeling.

From a state of mindful awareness, we can sit nonreactively with the felt-energy we’ve invested in some way-of-being. Holding space like this, we allow that feeling to express, unfolding and then fading, thus declining to reinforce that pattern. Working with the felt-associations is important, because feeling ultimately drives our choices, thus our patterns.

By relating nonreactively to the associations of feeling that typically spur our patterns, we can more consciously “select” and “deselect” the ways-of-being we invest our energy in, letting some go while consciously choosing to reinforce others. 
 
I mostly talk about this in terms of felt-energy and self-healing, which surely comes across as more woo. Fortunately for the woo-allergic, it also works to change the associated feedback loop in the brain. The neural angle and the felt-energy angle are complementary, and understanding both gives a fuller picture of how we can effectively do this. 

## Tilling the Soil
So, tilling the soil is essentially a self-inquiry technique. The aim is to acknowledge, resolve, and move past some old habits of thought and feeling, old beliefs and emotions. Doing so makes space for the new patterns we’re going to craft and seed. 

Our lives are already full of our habitual, conditioned ways of being. To effectively reshape some aspect of our lives, we need to let those present patterns go. Say, for example, you’ve got an aversion to exercise, and belief-patterns that it’s too hard, or painful, or whatever. These are not absolute facts about you - more likely they’re learned associations conditioned by earlier experiences. They can be processed and changed, so that new patterns can take their place.
 
This is necessarily done on the level of feeling, where we can do self-inquiry and work with mindful awareness to navigate our patterns. The goal is to identify and release associations of feeling, and to process and move through old beliefs. Doing this allows us to seed and grow a new schema in place of the old one.

In more tangible terms, we perform a mindful inquiry by mindmapping our patterns in some domain. This creates awareness of the schema we’ve got in that area of life - what beliefs we hold, and what feeling is invested in those. Becoming aware of these patterns allows us to “audit” them, taking a look at whether or not they’re things we want to keep reinforcing about ourselves. 

Feeling will be associated with a belief-structure, some habitually told story about you and the domain. For example, you might have a lot of fear associated with sharing your authentic personality, and that might come with a belief-structure like “people will hate who I really am. I have a shitty sense of humor and no-one even likes me”. 

Once we mindmap to make those old patterns tangible, we can use mindful awareness to hold space for and process that fear, which then tends to help with working through the beliefs, too. You transition into a state of mindful presence, invite the feeling to express, and hold space for it to unfold.

The key here is to allow felt-sensation to well-up in your being, but to stay nonreactive to the thoughts and behaviors that may want to come along with it. Working with frustration, for example, can involve sitting with and releasing a lot of tension from the forehead and jaw, and often the trunk. Focusing on frustrated thoughts tends to reinforce that pattern of tension, which is not what we want to do. Staying with the feeling, instead, allows it to process and fade.

Sometimes it takes one minute, sometimes five or ten, but the feeling will always fade. By letting feeling express without reacting to it, you loosen your energetic investment in that pattern. That feeling-motivator didn’t successfully spur a behavior and lead to a reward, so it isn’t reinforced as a useful association. You’ve also declined to activate the neural pathways which correspond to that behavior, so those aren’t reinforced either.

With that feeling processed, it’s usually clearer that you can cease to reinforce its partner belief. Say you resolve a pattern of annoyance with regular housework. Then it’s easier to see that the associated habitual narrative (like “man I really hate cleaning, I’m so sick of washing dishes”) can also be let go, and replaced with thinking that’ll support a more consciously chosen felt-state.

## Repeat it a few times
Each time you repeat this, holding space for that feeling to express, the subjectively-felt momentum of the pattern fades. Each repetition reduces its strength, making it easier to move beyond the associated thoughts and behaviors as well.

This release of felt-energy is repeated as necessary, gradually slowing the momentum of a pattern, further releasing habitual investment of felt-energy in that pattern, and declining to reinforce the corresponding neural pathways.

*In my experience, this self-inquiry-based approach to resolution of old emotional patterns works well for many habit-spaces, like exercise, morning routines, cleaning, productivity, and so on. Sometimes the tension goes deeper, and sometimes it’s shallower. When it’s deeper, it’s more of a process to fully feel-into, hold space for, and resolve felt-associations, but it works well with patient attention.

I’m not sure that it’s suitable for trauma or other deep, painful emotional tensions. I have had some personal success with this in resolving fairly deep stuff around childhood emotional neglect, but I won’t just say this works for anything, and I don’t know nearly enough about trauma to give an informed, credible opinion on that.

This is where this phase can be a “slot” in a framework more than a “step” in a process. If you have some preferred technique(s) for emotional processing which also works to release momentum from old patterns, you can probably use those in place of this self-inquiry approach. You know yourself best, after all.

In this case, focus more on the principle than the specific practice, here. The key is to divest felt-energy from old patterns, so that you’re no longer pulled to habitually carry them out, making space for reinvestment of your energy into some new way-of-being.*

We don’t have to rely on self-”control” - mindful awareness gives us this other option, to simply navigate feeling from a nonreactive state. This is a sort of “deselecting” function, where we reduce the grip some way-of-actualizing has on our lives by removing our investment of energy in it.

This can sound pretty woo, but it’s practical, too. Releasing an investment of felt-energy effectively divests you from the corresponding feedback loop in the brain, by preventing it from kicking into action in the first place. It’s also important to understand and work through old belief-patterns and emotions on that woo-level, so that we don’t just accumulate unprocessed inner clutter while trying to grow on top of that. 

It’s essential to work with investments of felt-energy, because feeling, whether it’s attraction or aversion, motivates our choices. This is a feature of our biology, an evolutionary adaptation that originally served to motivate us towards advantageous things and away from disadvantageous ones. Felt-associations are like navigational indicators - do go here, don’t touch that, do eat that, do run from that giant snake, and so on. 

If feeling largely shapes our choices, then being able to consciously work with our associations of feeling enables us to more skillfully shape our-selves. This is especially true in a world where many short-term pleasures result in long-term stagnation, and many short-term difficulties give long-term benefits.  

## This process results in freed energy

Carrying out this first phase results in some energy regained, and an initially catalyzed divestment from present patterns. It’s a conscious choice to cease re-actualizing old patterns, releasing from them the energy usually allocated to carrying them out, reducing the hold that feeling has on us. This returns that energy to you, and clears space for new growth.

Doing this inquiry and emotional processing also tends to expand your sense of the new patterns you want to create. As you go, note down any ideas that arise. Keep a simple page at hand, noting how you may want to shift your belief structures, what new feeling you may want to create in this domain. This note-gathering leads into the first part of composing a new pattern, where we create a new schema to seed and grow.

As the process continues, we keep up with this divestment. In composition we’ll craft and seed new patterns of feeling and thinking, while continuing to loosen and uproot the old patterns. We grow a new schema while releasing the old, which supports actualization of a new behavioral pattern, too.

## Here’s an example of how this can go
To reshape my morning patterns, I carried out an inquiry into my present habits of thought and feeling around mornings. Focusing that domain, I invited those patterns to express and found that, lo and behold, over a decade of early-morning school bus runs in New York winters gave me deeply negative associations with morningtime. These were largely feelings of annoyance, frustration, and unwillingness, accompanied by a schema with such notables as “god f**ing dammit I hate mornings”, “Do I really have to get up again??”, and “f**k, mornings are the worst.”
  
To clear this out, I held space for that old emotion to express. I focused on the sensation in my body - tension in my face and jaw, a weighty feeling in my trunk - simply being present to those feelings until they loosened and faded. 

Working through feeling also tends to make clear how to move from old to new belief structures. So I reasoned through the thought-patterns that arose, accepting that they’re simply habitual and not absolutely definitive of all that I can be. 

To move past unuseful old beliefs, I take a pragmatic stance of default bias towards what’s good for me, whether or not it currently feels true or right or possible. So even if the current patterns say “f**ck all this growing and getting better shit”, you can disidentify from those and reason “hey, just because these patterns have persisted beyond my adolescence doesn’t mean I need to keep them. They aren’t an absolute definition of who I am or want to be.”

To support a new morning routine, I consciously chose morningtime associations of pleasure and gratitude, and a belief that “I can enjoy the morning!” This is set up in composition (phase two) and later practiced to condition the growth of those new patterns.
