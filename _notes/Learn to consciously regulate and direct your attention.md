title: Learning to consciously regulate and direct your attention

*Seeded July 30, 2021*

[[Your energy goes where your attention goes]], so it's crucial to learn to effectively regulate and direct that attention. 

If you [[cultivate your awareness through a practice like mindfulness, you're equipping yourself to better guide attention]], thus better wield your energy. If you can effectively wield that attention, you'll be able to invest in your growth and divest from limiting habits.

We need to be able to consciously direct our energy if we want to achieve anything else, because [[growth is an investment]] of energy, and investments require regular, consistent input.
