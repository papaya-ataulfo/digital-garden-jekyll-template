title: Habits have momentum

*Seeded June 7, 2021*

Habits gain momentum, psychoemotionally and neurophysiologically, over time.

Strong beliefs formed around a habit integrate into our identities, strengthening our adherence to that pattern - though this can be [[more difficult with positive habits than negative ones]]. Also, [[beliefs are self-reinforcing feedback loops]], which further create and maintain momentum.

Then, [[consistency creates myelin]], enhancing the function of a habit's neural pathways. These strengthened pathways are essentially a build-up of momentum. By becoming the paths of least resistance, they enable the corresponding habit to unfold more and more easily.

It's also important to remember that [[Momentum and inertia are two sides of the same coin]], such that the above can be very useful for stabilizing desired habits, yet also a source of difficulty when dissolving unwanted habits. 

These dynamics are essential to learn to mindfully navigate so that we can shape our habits.
