title: There are (at least) two primary modes of awareness
---

*Seeded August 1, 2021*

I tend to think about awareness as a spectrum, with "Focused" on one end, "Released" on the other, and Default-Mode monkey-mind in the middle.

[[Focus is how you invest, wield, concentrate your energy|Focus is when you're consciously directing your attention to some task]], exerting energy for it. This is exemplified by [[flow]], which seems to take the cake as the highest form of focus.

[[Release is how you divest, work through resistances, stretch, relax|Release is when you're consciously relaxing, surrendering]], like in a meditative state. Like you can lose your-self in flow, so too you can dissolve during deep meditative experience, which suggests that [[Focus and release are two sides of the same coin|the two are intimately related]].

Then default mode is monkey-mind, the distracted, dopamine seeking, less-than-mindful state we're all so familiar with.
