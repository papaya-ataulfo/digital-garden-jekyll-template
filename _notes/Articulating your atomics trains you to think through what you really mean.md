## Articulating your atomics trains you to think through what you really mean

[[Most of us take our thinking for granted]]. We don't ever take the time to untangle the messy bundles of thoughts that we have and establish clear, coherent meaning. 

Articulating your atomics asks you to take your uninvestigated thoughts and make sense of them. [[One note receives one thought]], so that you build clarity unit-by-unit. Putting your models into words forces you to choose tangible, structured forms which ground that thinking. 

Regularly practicing this conditions cognitive competency, trains our intuitions ([[Learn to judge what is atomic by intuition]]) and encourages us to remember that we don't really know what we think until we [[Make it tangible]].
