title: Articulating your atomics trains you to think through what you really mean
---

*Seeded May 26, 2021*

[[Many of us take our thinking for granted]]. We don't really take the time to untangle the messy bundles of thoughts that we have and find clear, coherent meanings (not that "completion" is real, or anything). 

Articulating your atomics asks you to take your uninvestigated thoughts and make sense of them. [[One note receives one thought]], such that you build clarity unit-by-unit. Putting your models into words forces you to choose tangible, structured forms which ground that thinking. 

Regularly practicing this conditions cognitive competency, [[Learn to judge what is atomic by intuition|trains our intuitions]], and encourages us to remember that we don't really know what we think until we [[make it tangible]].
